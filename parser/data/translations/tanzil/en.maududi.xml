	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif. Lam. Mim."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This is the Book of Allah: there is no doubt about it. It is guidance to Godfearing people,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="who believe in the unseen, establish the Salats and expend (in Our way) out of what We have bestowed on them;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="who believe in the Book We have sent down to you (i.e. the Qur'an) and in the Books sent down before you, and firmly believe in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="5" text="Such people are on the right way from their Lord and such are truly successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for those who have rejected (these things), it is all the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them: they are not going to believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah has sealed up their hearts and ears and a covering has fallen over their eyes, and they have incurred the severest punishment."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then there are some who say, &quot;We believe in Allah and the Last Day&quot;, whereas they do not believe at all."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They thus try to deceive Allah and the Believers, but they succeed in deceiving none except themselves and they realize it not."/>
		<aya index="10" text="In their hearts is a disease which Allah has increased all the more and a painful doom is in store for them for the lie they utter."/>
		<aya index="11" text="Whenever it is said to them, &quot;Spread not disorder on the earth&quot;, their reply is, &quot;We only seek to put things aright&quot;."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Beware! they do spread disorder but they realize it not."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when it is said to them, &quot;Believe sincerely as the other people have believed&quot;, they reply, &quot;Should we believe as fools have believed?&quot; Beware! they themselves are the fools, but they know it not."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet those who believe, they say, &quot;We, too, are believers&quot;, but when they privily meet their evil geniuses, they say, &quot;Indeed we are with you: we are only mocking at these people&quot;."/>
		<aya index="15" text="(Little do they realize that) Allah is mocking at them. He gives them rope enough, and they wander on and on blindly in their mischief and rebellion."/>
		<aya index="16" text="These are the people who have bartered away Guidance for error, but this is a profitless bargain that they have made, and they are not at all on the right way."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their condition may be described in a parable: a man kindled a fire and when it illuminated all around him, Allah took away the light from their eyes and left them in utter darkness, where they could not see anything."/>
		<aya index="18" text="They are deaf; they are dumb; they are blind so they will not return (to the right way)."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or (still another parable may be cited to depict their condition): heavy rain is falling from the sky, accompanied by pitch darkness, thunder and lightning. When they hear the thunderclap, they thrust their fingers into their ears for fear of death, but Allah is encircling the disbelievers on all sides."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning terrifies them as if it were going to snatch away their eyesight from them. When they see light, they move on a little further and When it becomes dark for them, they stand still. Had Allah so willed, He could have deprived them totally of their hearing and their sight. Most surely Allah has power over everything."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O Mankind, submit to your Lord Who created you and those who were before you; in this way only you may expect to save yourselves."/>
		<aya index="22" text="It is He Who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky a canopy; and it is He Who sends down rain from above for the growth of every kind of food products for your sustenance. So, when you know this, you should not set up equals to rank with Allah."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if you be in doubt whether the Book We have sent down to Our Servant is from Us or not, then produce, at least, one Surah like this. You may call all your associates to assist you and avail yourselves of the help of any one other than Allah. If you are genuine in your doubt, do this."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you do not do this, and you can never do this, then fear the Fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers and which shall have men and stones for fuel."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And give good news (O Muhammad), to those who believe in this Book and do good deeds (in accordance with its teachings). For them there will be gardens underneath which canals flow. Their fruits will so resemble the fruits on the Earth that every time they will be provided with fruits, they will say, &quot;Such fruits were provided to us before on the Earth. &quot; And there will be pure spouses for them and therein they will live for ever."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Well, Allah is not ashamed to cite the similitude of a gnat or of something even more insignificant than this. As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, &quot;What does Allah mean by such similitudes?&quot; Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing. And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it; who cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and who produce chaos on the Earth. These are the people who are indeed the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How is it that you adopt the attitude of disbelief towards Allah when the fact is that you were lifeless and He gave you life, and He will take away life from you and will again restore you to life: then you shall ultimately return to Him."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He it is Who created for you all that there is on the Earth; He then turned to the sky and ordered it into seven heavens. And He has full knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Just recall the time when your Lord said to the angels, &quot;I am going to appoint a vicegerent on the Earth.&quot; They humbly enquired, &quot;Are you going to appoint such a one as will cause disorder and shed blood on the Earth? We are already engaged in hymning Your praise, and hallowing Your name&quot;."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Allah replied, &quot;I know what you do not know.&quot; After this he taught Adam the names of all things. Then He set these before the angels and asked, &quot;Tell Me the names of these things, if you are right (in thinking that the appointment of a vicegerent will cause disorder)&quot;."/>
		<aya index="32" text="They replied, &quot;Glory be to You. You alone are free from defect. We possess only that much knowledge which You have given us. Indeed You alone are All-Knowing and All-Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Then Allah said to Adam, &quot;Tell them the names of these things.&quot; When Adam told them the names of all those things, Allah declared, &quot;Did I not tell you that I know those truths about the Earth and the Heavens which are hidden from you? I know what you disclose and what you hide.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="Then We commanded the angels, &quot;Bow yourselves to Adam. &quot;All bowed but Iblis refused to do so; he waxed proud and joined the defiers."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Then We said, &quot;O Adam, you and your wife, both dwell in the Garden and eat to your hearts' content where from you will, but do not go near this tree; otherwise you shall become transgressors&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="After a time Satan tempted them with that tree to disobey. Our Command and brought them out of the state they were in, and We decreed, &quot;Now, go down all of you from here; you are enemies of one another. Henceforth you shall dwell and provide for yourselves on the Earth for a specified period.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="At that time Adam learnt appropriate words from his Lord and repented, and his Lord accepted his repentance, for He is very Relenting and very Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said, &quot;Now go down, all of you from here. Henceforth there shall come to you Guidance from Me now and again: whoever will follow it shall have neither fear nor sorrow"/>
		<aya index="39" text="and whoever will refuse to accept it and defy Our Revelations they shall be doomed to the Fire wherein they shall remain for ever."/>
		<aya index="40" text="O children of Israel! Just recall to mind My favour wherewith I blessed you fulfil your covenant with Me and I shall fulfil My covenant with you, and fear Me alone."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in the Book I have now sent down; as it confirms the Scriptures you already possess, be not the first to reject it; barter not away My Revelations for paltry worldly gain, and guard yourselves against My wrath"/>
		<aya index="42" text="Confound not the Truth with falsehood nor conceal it knowingly."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Establish the Salat, pay the Zakat and bow down before Me along with those who bow down."/>
		<aya index="44" text="How is it that you enjoin others to follow the Right Way, but forget it yourselves, though you read the Scriptures? Have you no sense at all?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Seek help with the Salat and fortitude: no doubt, Salat is a hard task but not for those obedient servants,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="who realize that ultimately they shall meet their Lord and shall return to Him."/>
		<aya index="47" text="O Children of Israel! Just recall to mind My favour that bestowed upon you, and remember that I exalted you above all the peoples of the world."/>
		<aya index="48" text="And guard yourselves against the Day when no one shall avail anyone anything; nor shall intercession be accepted from anyone; nor shall anyone be acquitted for any (amount of) ransom; nor shall the guilty ones be helped from any quarter."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Recall the time when We delivered you from the slavery of Pharaoh's people. They had inflicted a dreadful torment on you: they killed your sons and let your daughters live. And in this there was a hard trial for you from your your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Remember the time when We parted the sea to make way for you and let you pass safely through it and then drowned Pharaoh's people before your very eyes."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Call to mind that when We invited Moses for a fixed term of forty nights and days, you took to calf worship in his absence. Though you had committed a wicked transgression,"/>
		<aya index="52" text="yet We pardoned you even after that so that you might become grateful."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Remember that (at that very time, when you were committing this gross iniquity) We gave Moses the Book and the criterion of right and wrong so that you might be guided aright."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Remember that when Moses (returned with the Divine Gift, he) said to his people, &quot;O my people, you have wronged yourselves grievously by taking the calf for worship. Therefore, turn to your Creator. in penitence and slay the guilty ones among you. This is best for you in the sight of your Creator.&quot; At that time your Creator accepted your repentance because He is Relenting 'and Merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Remember when you said, &quot;O Moses, we are not going to believe you until we see with our own eyes Allah (talking to you)&quot;. At that very time a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on and you fell lifeless."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you to life so that you might become grateful for this favour."/>
		<aya index="57" text="(Remember that) We caused the cloud to overshadow you and provided you with manna and salva for your food, saying, &quot;Eat of the clean and pure things We have bestowed upon you&quot; (In spite of this, your forefathers violated Our commands:) however, they did not harm Us but harmed only themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Then call to mind the time when We said, &quot;Go into the town' before you and eat to your hearts' content therein, wherefrom you will, but enter the gate bowing down with humility, repeating 'hittatun'; We will forgive your sins and increase the reward of the righteous&quot;."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But the transgressors perverted the words said to them entirely into a different thing. So We sent down upon the transgressors a severe torment from the sky: that was the punishment for the disobedience they were showing."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Remember that when Moses prayed for water for his people, We answered, &quot;Strike the rock with your staff&quot;: whereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it; the people of every clan came to know their drinking place. (Then they were enjoined:) &quot;Eat and drink of what Allah has provided and do not spread disorder on the earth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Remember: You grumbled: &quot;O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food. Pray your Lord to bring for us the products of the earth green herbs, vegetables, corn, garlic, onions, pulses and the like.&quot; Moses replied: &quot;What! would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler? Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand.&quot; By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah and kill His Messengers without any just cause; that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Rest assured that whosoever from among the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians or the Sabaeans believes in Allah and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, he will have his reward with his Lord and he will have no cause for fear and grief."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Call to mind the time when We raised above you the Tur and made a covenant with you, saying, &quot;Hold fast to the Book which We are giving you and bear in mind the commands and precepts contained therein. It is expected that this will lead you on to the paths of virtue and piety.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="But even after that you forsook the Covenant: nevertheless Allah did not withhold His grace and mercy from you; otherwise you would have been utterly ruined long before this."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And you know well the story of those among you who broke Sabbath. We said to them, &quot;Be apes despised and hated by all."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Thus We made their end a warning to the people of their time and succeeding generations, and an admonition for God-fearing people."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Then call to mind the other event: when Moses said to his people, &quot;Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow,&quot; they replied, &quot;Do you mean to have a jest with us?&quot; He answered, &quot;I crave Allah's protection from behaving like ignorant people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="Then they said, &quot;Please make a request to your Lord to give us some details of the cow.&quot; Moses answered, &quot;Allah says that the cow should neither be old nor immature but of middle age. Do, therefore, as you are bidden.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="But they further asked, &quot;Please request your Lord to make it clear to us of what colour she should be.&quot; Moses answered, &quot;He says that she should be of yellow colour, so deep and bright as to delight the beholders.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Again they said, &quot;Pray your Lord to specify for us the kind of cow that is required; for cows (of this type) look alike to us. We shall then find her, if God so wills.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="Moses answered, &quot;Allah says that she should be a cow which has not been yoked nor has ploughed the land nor watered the fields; which is sound and whole, without belemish. &quot; Then they cried out, &quot;Now you have given an accurate description. &quot; Then they sacrificed her but they did not appear to be doing this willingly."/>
		<aya index="72" text="You should also recall to mind another incident: You slew a man and began to dispute about the murder and accuse one another of it, but Allah had decreed that what you were trying to hide should be disclosed."/>
		<aya index="73" text="So We commanded, &quot;Strike the corpse of the murdered man with a part of the sacrificed cow. See how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His Signs, so that you may understand&quot;."/>
		<aya index="74" text="But even after seeing these Signs your hearts hardened and became as hard as rocks; nay, even harder than rocks. For there are some rocks out of which springs gush forth, and others which split open, and water issues out of them; then there are some which tumble down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you are doing."/>
		<aya index="75" text="O Muslims, do you then expect that these people will accept your invitation and become believers? whereas there have always been among them some who have been hearing the Word of God, understanding it well and then perverting and tampering with it knowingly."/>
		<aya index="76" text="When they meet those who believe in Muhammad, they say, &quot;We also believe in him.&quot; But when they meet one another in private, they say, &quot;Have you got no sense that you disclose to them those things which Allah has revealed to you so that they might bring them as a proof against you before your Lord?"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they really not know that Allah is fully aware of what they hide and what they disclose?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Then there are among them some un-lettered people who have no knowledge of the Book but depend upon empty hopes and are guided by mere conjecture and guess-work."/>
		<aya index="79" text="So woe to their learned people, who write the law with their own hands and then say to the people, &quot;This is from Allah,&quot; so that they might gain some paltry worldly end. (They do not see that) this writing of their hands will bring woe to them and what they gain thereby will lead to their ruin."/>
		<aya index="80" text="They also say, &quot;The fire of Hell is not going to touch us, and even if it does at all, it will be only for a few days&quot;. Say, &quot;Have you obtained a promise from Allah which He would not break? Or, do you attribute to Allah things you do not know? Why will not the fire of Hell touch you?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Whoever earns evil and becomes engrossed in sin shall be doomed to Hell and abide therein for ever."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Only those people who believe and do good deeds, will be the dwellers of the Garden and live there for ever."/>
		<aya index="83" text="Remember that We made a solemn covenant with the children of Israel to this effect: worship none save Allah: be good to your parents, to your relatives, to the orphans and to the helpless; speak aright with the people: establish the Salat and pay the Zakat. But with the exception of a few, you all slid back from it and are paying no heed to it even now."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Remember also that We made another solemn covenant with you: you shall not shed blood among yourselves nor expel one another from your homes. And you confirmed it and you are a witness to it."/>
		<aya index="85" text="But inspite of this, you are killing your brethren and driving them out from their homes and making unjust and aggressive alliances against one another. And when they come to you as captives, you trade on their ransoms whereas their expulsion itself was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in one part of the Scriptures and disbelieve in the other? What other punishment do such people from among you deserve except an ignominious life in this world and the most grievous doom on the Day of Resurrection? Allah is not unaware of what you are doing."/>
		<aya index="86" text="These are the people who have preferred the worldly life to the life in the Hereafter. Therefore their torment shall not be lightened nor shall help be given to them (from any quarter)."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And We gave Moses the Book and sent after him a train of Messengers in succession. Then We sent Jesus, son of Mary, with clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Then how is it that whenever a Messenger came to you wish that which did not suit your lusts, you grew rebellious against him, and repudiated some and slew others."/>
		<aya index="88" text="They say, &quot;Our hearts are secure.&quot; Nay, the fact is that Allah has cursed them for their disbelief; so they are little disposed to believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And how are they behaving now towards a Book which has come to them from Allah? Inspite of the fact that it confirms the Scriptures which they already possessed. and, inspite of the fact that, before it came, they used to pray for a signal victory over the disbelievers, they rejected it when it came, although they recognized it. May Allah's curse be upon such disbelievers!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="What a mean thing it is with which they delude their minds. They reject the Guidance which Allah has sent down merely because of their grudge why Allah has in His bounty sent it to whom He chose from amongst His servants. They have thus incurred wrath after wrath, and for such disbelievers there is a disgraceful doom."/>
		<aya index="91" text="When it is said to them, &quot;Believe in that which Allah has sent down,&quot; they say, &quot;We believe only in that which has been sent to us&quot;, and reject everything else, though it is the Truth and confirms what is with them. Well, ask them, &quot;If you sincerely believed in what was sent down to you, why did you kill the Messengers of Allah (who were sent to you from amongst yourselves)?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="(More than that:) Moses came to you with clear Signs, yet no sooner was he away from you than you transgressed and took the calf for worship."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Recall also to mind the Covenant We made with you while We raised the Tur over you: `Follow strictly the precepts We are giving you and give ear to Our Commandments.' Your forefathers replied, &quot;We have heard but we will not obey.&quot; They were so prone to unbelief that they cherished the calf in their hearts. Tell them (O Muhammad). &quot;If indeed you are believers, yours is a strange Faith that enjoins you to do such evil things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say to them, &quot;If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is exclusively reserved for you and not for the rest of mankind, then you should long for death, if you arc sincere in your claim.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="Believe it that they will never wish for it, for (they are fully aware of the consequences of) what they have sent before them for the Hereafter. And Allah knows well the mentality of the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="96" text="You will find that, of all mankind, they are the greediest for life, nay, they are even greedier than the mushriks. Each one of them longs to have a life Of a thousand years, but a long life can, by no means, remove them away from the scourge, for Allah is watching whatever they are doing."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say to them, &quot;Whoever is enemy to Gabriel, should understand that he has, by Allah's command, revealed to your heart the Qur'an which confirms what was revealed before it, and brings Guidance and glad tidings to the Believers."/>
		<aya index="98" text="(If their enmity to Gabriel is due to this, let them understand that) whoever is enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Gabriel and Michael, Allah is enemy to such disbelievers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We have sent down to you Revelations that clearly expound the Truth, and none but the disobedient reject them."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Has it not always been so that every time they made a covenant, some of them set it aside? Nay, most of them never believe in it sincerely."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And whenever a Messenger came to them from Allah, confirming that Scripture which they already possessed, some from among the people of the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as though they knew nothing about it."/>
		<aya index="102" text="(Instead of this,) they began to follow that (magic) to which the devils falsely attributed (the greatness of) the kingdom of Solomon. In fact Solomon was never involved in any practice of disbelief, but the satans, who taught magic to the people were themselves guilty of disbelief. They were after that thing which was sent to Harut and Marut, the two angels at Babylon. Whenever these two angels taught black art to anyone, they would always give a clear warning beforehand, saying, &quot;We are merely a trial for you; so you should not commit blasphemy. But in spite of this warning, those people used to learn from the angels the art which caused division between husband and wife. Although it was obvious that they could not do any harm to anyone by means of this magic without Allah's permission, yet they learnt that art which could not be profitable even for them but was actually harmful. Moreover, they knew it full well that anyone, who purchased that art, would have no share in the Hereafter. What a vile commodity it was for which they sold off their souls, if they had but known it!"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Had they believed in Allah and practised piety, they would have received a far better reward from AIIah, if they had but known it."/>
		<aya index="104" text="O Believers, do not say. &quot;Ra 'ina&quot; but say, &quot;Unzurna &quot; and listen a to what is said; for the disbelievers deserve a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="105" text="The people who have rejected the message of Truth, be they the people of the Book or the mushriks, would never like that any good be sent down to you from your Lord, but Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is Most Bountiful."/>
		<aya index="106" text="We bring a better verse or at least the like of it for whatever we abrogate or cause it to be forgotten."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that Allah has full power over everything? Do you not know that the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone and that you have neither any protector nor helper beside Him?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Would you then ask your Prophet such questions as were asked of Moses in former times? In fact, anyone, who changes the way of belief for that of disbelief, has surely swerved from the Right way."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the people of the Book desire to turn you anyhow back to unbelief. They wish this out of the envy of their hearts though the Truth has become quite clear to them. Yet, you should show forbearance and forgiveness to them' till Allah Himself enforces His judgement."/>
		<aya index="110" text="(Rest assured that) Allah has full power over everything: establish the Salat and pay the Zakat. you will find with Allah whatever good you send forward for your future; Allah is watching everything you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="They say, &quot;None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or according to the Christians) a Christian.&quot; These are their wishful fancies. Say to them, &quot;Bring your proof, if you are right in your claim.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="The fact is that no one has any special claim to Paradise; whoever surrenders himself to Allah in obedience and follows the Right Way, shall get his reward from his Lord: there shall be neither fear nor grief for such people."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say that the Christians have nothing (of the Truth) and the Christians say that the Jews have nothing of it, though both read the Scripture. And those who have no knowledge of the Scripture also make similar claims. Allah will surely give His judgement on the Day of Resurrection in all the matters in which they differ."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who could be a greater wrongdoer than the one who forbids the mention of Allah's name in places of worship and strives for their ruin? Such people do not deserve to enter the places of worship, and, if they enter at all, they should do so in fear; for there is ignominy for them in this world and an awful punishment in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="115" text="The East and the West, all belong to Allah: you will face Allah in whichsoever direction you turn your face: Allah is All-Embracing and All-Knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="They say &quot;Allah has adopted a son.&quot; Allah is above such things. As a matter of fact, whatever is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him and all are obedient to Him."/>
		<aya index="117" text="He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth: when He decrees a thing, He merely says, &quot;Be,&quot; and there it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="The ignorant people say, &quot;Why does not Allah Himself talk to us or why does not a Sign come to us?&quot; The people before them also talked like this, for all (who swerve from the Right Path) have the same mentality. We have already shown clear Signs to those who believe;"/>
		<aya index="119" text="(what greater Sign could there be than that) We have sent you with the knowledge of the Truth and made you a bearer of good tidings and a Warner? Now, you are not responsible and answerable for those who are bent upon going to Hell."/>
		<aya index="120" text="The Jews and the Christians will never be satisfied with you, O Muhammad, until you follow their way. Tell them plainly, &quot;The right way is shown by Allah.&quot; And if, after all the' knowledge you have received, you were to yield to their desires, you shall find neither any friend nor helper to protect you from Allah's wrath."/>
		<aya index="121" text="There are those, even among the people of the Scripture, who read the Book as it should be read and believe in it sincerely; as for those who reject it, they are indeed the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O children of Israel, remember that special favour I bestowed upon you, and that I exalted you above all the communities of the world."/>

(In that case) there is no harm if they re-marry, provided that the woman and her first husband are convinced that they will be able to keep within the bounds fixed by Allah. And these are Allah's bounds, which He makes clear for the guidance of those who know (the consequences of transgression)."/>
		<aya index="231" text="And when you have divorced your wives and they are about to complete their prescribed term, then either retain them gracefully or release them generously. It is transgression to retain them merely for harassment; and whoever' does that indeed wrongs his own self. Do not play with Allah's Commandments, and remember that Allah has blessed you with a great favour. He admonishes you to show due respect to the Book and the Wisdom He has sent to you. Fear Allah and know that He is fully aware of everything."/>
		<aya index="232" text="When you have divorced your wives absolutely and they have completed their prescribed term, then you should not prevent them from marrying their prospective husbands, if they mutually agree to marry each other in a lawful way. You are enjoined not to commit such an offence, if you sincerely believe in Allah and the Last Day. It is most decent and pure for you to desist from this; Allah knows and you do not know."/>

In that case the father of the child shall, in the fair known way, be responsible for their food and clothing. But none should be burdened with more than one can bear: neither the mother should be pressed unjustly (to accept unfair terms) just because she is the mother nor should the father be burdened just because he is the father. And the same responsibility for the maintenance of the mother devolves upon the father of the child and his heir. There is no harm if they wean the child by mutual consent and consultation. Moreover, there is no harm if you choose to give your children a suckle by a wet nurse, provided that you pay her fairly. Fear Allah and know it well that whatever you do is in the sight of Allah."/>
		<aya index="234" text="If those of you, who die, leave wives behind, they should abstain (from marriage) for four months and ten days. Then when their waiting term expires, they are free to do whatever they choose for themselves, provided that it is decent; you shall not be answerable for this; Allah is fully aware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="235" text="It is no offence if you make indirect proposal of marriage to widows during their waiting term or keep it concealed in your hearts: for Allah knows that you will naturally think of them. But be careful not to make any secret engagement. If you have to do anything, do it in an honourable way. And you should not settle anything finally about the marriage until the waiting term expires. Understand it well that Allah even knows what is hidden in your hearts; so fear Him. Also know that Allah is Lenient and Forgiving."/>
		<aya index="236" text="It is no sin if you divorce your wives while you have not yet touched them or fixed any dower for them. In such a case, pay them something anyhow. A rich man should pay fairly according to his means and a poor man according to his resources, for this is an obligation on the righteous people."/>
		<aya index="237" text="In case you fixed a dower for them and then divorced them before you touched them, you should pay half of the fixed dower. But there is no harm if the woman agrees to forego it or the man, in whose hands is the marriage tie, is generous enough (to pay the dower in full). And if you (men) act generously, it is akin to piety. Do not forget to show generosity in your dealings with one another for Allah sees what you do."/>

Afterwards when Saul, and those who had believed with him, crossed the river and advanced forward, the former said to Saul, &quot;We have no power left this day to fight against Goliath and his hosts.&quot; But those who believed that one Day they shall meet Allah, declared, &quot;lt has often been that a small host has, by Allah's grace, overcome a big host: for Allah is with those who show fortitude.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="253" text="Of these Messengers (whom We sent for the guidance of mankind), We raised some above the others in rank. Among them was one with whom Allah Himself had direct talks. There were others whom He raised high in rank in other ways. Likewise We gave clear signs to Jesus, son of Mary, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah so willed the people who had seen clear signs would not have fought against one another after the Prophets. But (it was not Allah's will to prevent people forcibly from differences: so) they disagreed; then some of them accepted the Truth and others rejected it.

		<aya index="258" text="Have you not considered the case of the person who had an argument with Abraham as to `Whom Abraham acknowledged as his Lord?'

Then have a look at your ass, (and see that his very bones have become rotten) and We have done this in order to make you a Sign for the people. Look, how We raise up the skeleton and set the bones (of the ass) and cover them with flesh and (put breath of life into them).&quot; And when the Reality became manifest to him, he said, &quot;I know that Allah has power over everything.&quot;"/>

The scribe whom Allah has given the gift of literacy should not refuse to write.

But if the borrower be of low understanding or weak or unable to dictate (for any reason), then let the guardian of his interests dictate it with equity. And let two men from among you bear witness to all such documents. But if two men be not available, there should be one man and two women to bear witness so that if one of the women forgets (anything), the other may remind her. The witnesses should be from among such people whom you approve of as witnesses. When the witnesses are asked to testify, they should not refuse to do so. Do not neglect to reduce to writing your transaction for a specified term, whether it be big or small. Allah considers this more just for you, for it facilitates the establishment of evidence and lessens doubts and suspicions. Of course, there is no harm if you do not put in writing the common transactions you conclude daily on the spot, but in case of commercial transactions you should have witnesses. The scribe and the witnesses should not be harassed: if you do so, you shall be guilty of sin. You should guard against the wrath of Allah; He gives you the knowledge of the right way for Allah has the knowledge of everything."/>

		<aya index="47" text="She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has ever touched me?' The angel answered: Thus shall it be. Allah creates whatever He wills. When He decides something, He merely says: &quot;Be&quot; and it is."/>

I will make for you from clay the likeness of a bird and then I will breathe into it and by the leave of Allah it will become a bird. I will also heal the blind and the leper, and by the leave of Allah bring the dead to life. I will also inform you of what things you eat and what you treasure up in your houses.

		<aya index="80" text="He will never enjoin you to take the angels or Prophets for your lords. Will he enjoin upon you unbelief when you have submitted yourselves to Allah?"/>

But should a Prophet come to you confirming that which is already with you, you shall believe in him and shall help him. So saying, Allah asked: 'Do you agree and accept to take up the burden of the covenant?' They answered: 'We agree,' He said: 'Then bear wirness; and I will be with you among the witness."/>

But once you are free from Pilgrimage obligations, you are free to hunt. Do not let your wrath against the people who have barred you from the Holy Mosque move you to commit undue transgressions; rather, help one another in acts of righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.

All these are sinful acts. This day the unbelievers have fully despaired of your religion. Do not fear them; but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion, and have bestowed upon you My bounty in full measure, and have been pleased to assign for you Islam as your religion.

		<aya index="43" text="Yet how will they appoint you a judge when they have the Torah with them, wherein there is Allah's judgement - and still they turn away from it? The fact is, they are not believers."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Surely We revealed the Torah, wherein there is guidance and light. Thereby did Prophets - who had submitted themselves (to Allah) - judge for the Judaized folk; and so did the scholars and jurists. They judged by the Book of Allah for they had been entrusted to keep it, and bear witness to it. So (O Jews!) do not fear men but fear Me, and do not barter away My signs for a trivial gain. Those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are indeed the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And therein We had ordained for them: 'A life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for all wounds, like for like.

		<aya index="46" text="And We sent Jesus, the son of Mary, after those Prophets, confirming the truth of whatever there still remained of the Torah.

		<aya index="47" text="Let the followers of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein, and those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Then We revealed the Book to you (O Muhammad!) with Truth, confirming whatever of the Book was revealed before, and protecting and guarding over it. Judge, then, in the affairs of men in accordance with the Law that Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires in disregard of the Truth which has come to you. For each of you We have appointed a Law and a way of life. And had Allah so willed, He would surely have made you one single community; instead, (He gave each of you a Law and a way of life) in order to test you by what He gave you. Vie, then, one with another in good works. Unto Allah is the return of all of you; and He will then make you understand the truth concerning the matters on which you disagreed."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Therefore, judge bet-ween them (O Muhammad!) by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their desires, and beware lest they tempt you away from anything of what Allah has revealed to you.

If any of you should ever turn away from your faith, remember that Allah will raise up a people whom He loves, and who love Him; a people humble towards the believers, and firm towards the unbelievers; who will strive hard in the way of Allah and will not fear the reproach of the reproacher. This is the favour of Allah which He grants to whom He wills. Allah is vast in resources, All-Knowing."/>

		<aya index="64" text="The Jews say: 'The Hand of Allah is fettered. It is their own hands which are fettered, and they stand cursed for the evil they have uttered. No! His Hands are outspread; He spends as He wills. Surely the message that has been revealed to you from your Lord has increased many of them in their in-surgence and unbelief, and so We have cast enmity and spite among them until the Day of Resurrection.

When death approaches you, let two men of equity among you act as witnesses when you make your bequest; or let two of those from others than yourselves act as witnesses if you are on a journey when the affliction of death befalls you. Then if any doubt occurs you shall detain both of them (in the mosque) after the Prayer, and they shall swear by Allah: 'We shall neither sell our testimony in return for any gain even though it concerns any near of kin nor shall we conceal our testimony which we owe to Allah, for then we should become among sinners.'."/>

		<aya index="5" text="And when Our scourge fell upon them their only cry was: 'We are indeed transgressors.'"/>
		<aya index="6" text="So We shall call to account those to whom Messengers were sent, and We shall call to account the Messengers (to see how dutifully they conveyed the Message, and how people responded to it)."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Then We shall narrate to them with knowledge the whole account. For surely, We were not away from them."/>
		<aya index="8" text="The weighing on that Day will be the true weighing: those whose scales are heavy will prosper."/>

		<aya index="12" text="Allah said: 'What prevented you from prostrating, when I commanded you to do so?' He said: 'I am better than he. You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.'"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Allah said: 'Then get you down from here. It does not behove you to be arrogant here. So be gone. You will be among the humiliated.'"/>

		<aya index="22" text="Thus Satan brought about their fall by deceit. And when they tasted of the tree, their shame became vislible to them, and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden.

		<aya index="60" text="The leading men of his people replied: 'We see that you are in palpable error.'"/>

		<aya index="64" text="But they charged him with falsehood. Thereupon We delivered Noah and those who were with him in the Ark, and caused those who rejected Our signs as false to be drowned. Surely they were a blind folk."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And to 'Ad We sent forth their brother Hud. He said: 'O my people! Serve Allah; you have no other god than Him. Will you, then, not avoid evil?'"/>
		<aya index="66" text="The unbelievers among the leading men of his people said: 'Indeed we see you in folly, and consider you to be liars.'"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He said: 'O my people! There is no folly in me; rather I am a Messenger from the Lord of the universe."/>
		<aya index="68" text="I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I give you sincere advice."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Do you wonder that an exhortation should come to you from your Lord through a man from amongst yourselves that he may warn you? And do call to mind when He made you successors after the people of Noah and amply increased you in stature. Remember then the wondrous bounties of Allah, that you may prosper.'"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said: 'Have you come to us that we should worship none other than Allah and forsake all whom our forefathers were wont to worship? Then bring upon us the scourge with which you have threatened us if you are truthful?'"/>
		<aya index="71" text="Hud warned them: 'Surely punishment and wrath from your Lord have befallen upon you. Do you dispute with me about mere names that you and your forefathers have concocted and for which Allah has sent down no sanction? Wait, then, and I too am with you among those who wait.'"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Then We delivered Hud and his companions by Our mercy, and We utterly cut off the last remnant of those who called the lie to Our signs and would not believe."/>
		<aya index="73" text="And to Thamud We sent forth their brother. Salih. He said to them: 'O my people! Serve Allah, you have no other god than Him. Truly there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord. This she-camel from Allah is a Divine portent for you. So leave her alone to pasture on Allah's earth, and touch her with no evil lest a painful chastisement should seize you."/>
		<aya index="74" text="And call to mind when He made you successors after 'Ad and gave you power in the earth so that you took for yourselves palaces in its plains and hewed out dwellings in the mountains. Remember, then, the wondrous bounties of Allah and do not go about creating mischief in the land.'"/>
		<aya index="75" text="The haughty elders of his people said to those believers who had been oppressed: 'Do you know that Salih is one sent forth with a message from his Lord?' They, replied: 'Surely we believe in the message with which he has been sent.'"/>
		<aya index="76" text="The haughty ones remarked. 'Most certainly we disbelieve in that which you believe.'"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Then they hamstrung the she-camel, disdainfuliy disobeyed the commandment of their Lord, and said: 'O Salih! Bring upon us the scourge with which you threatened us if you are truly a Messenger [of Allah].'"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Thereupon a shocking catastrophe seized them, so that they lay prostrate in their dwellings."/>
		<aya index="79" text="And Salih left them, saying: 'O my people! I conveyed to you the message of my Lord and gave you good advice; but you have no liking for your well-wishers.'"/>
		<aya index="80" text="And remember when We sent Lot [as a Messeng to his people and he said to them: 'Do you realize you practise an indecency of which no other people in the world were guilty of before you?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="You approach men lustfully in place of women. You are a people who exceed all bounds.'"/>
		<aya index="82" text="Their only answer was: 'Banish them from your town. They are a people who pretend to be pure.'"/>
		<aya index="83" text="Then We delivered Lot and his household save his wife who stayed behind,"/>
		<aya index="84" text="and We let loose a shower [of stones] upon them, Observe, then, the end of the evil-doers."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And to Midian We sent forth their brother Shu'ayb He exhorted them: O my people! Serve Allah, you have no god but Him. Indeed a clear proof has come to you from your Lord. So give just weight and measure and diminish not to men their things ' and make no mischief on the earth after it has been set in good order. That is to your own good, if you truly believe."/>
		<aya index="86" text="And do not lie in ambush by every path [of life] seeking to overawe or to hinder from the path of Allah those who believe, nor seek to make the path crooked. Remember, how you were once few, and then He multiplied you, and keep in mind what was the end of mischiefmakers."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And if there are some among you who believe in the message that I bear while some do not believe, have patience till Allah shall judge between us. He is the best of those who judge.'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="The haughty elders of his people said: 'O Shu'ayb! We shall certainly banish you and your companions-in-faith from our town, or else you shall return to our faith.' Shu'ayb said: 'What! Even though we abhor [your faith]?"/>
		<aya index="89" text="If we return to your faith after Allah has delivered us from it we would be fabricating a lie against Allah. nor can we return to it again unless it be by, the will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has knowledge of all things, and in Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Judge rightly between us and our people, for You are the best of those who judge.'"/>
		<aya index="90" text="The elders of his people who disbelieved said: 'Should you follow Shu'ayb, you will be utter losers."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Thereupon a shocking catastrophe seized them, and they remained prostrate in their dwellings."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Those who had charged Shu'ayb with lying became as though-they had never lived there; it is they who became utter losers."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Shu'ayb then departed from his people, and said: 'O my people! Surely I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and gave you sincere advice. How, then, can I mourn for a people who refuse to accept the truth?'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Never have We sent a Prophet to a place without trying its people with adversity and hardship that they may humble themselves."/>
		<aya index="95" text="Then We changed adversity into ease until they throve and said: 'Our forefathers had also seen both adversity and prosperity.' So We suddenly seized them without their even perceiving it."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Had the people of those towns believed and been God-fearing, We would certainly have opened up to them blessings from the heavens and the earth; but they gave the lie [to their Prophets] and so We seized them for their deeds. so."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Do the people of those towns feel secure that Our punishment will not come to them at night while they are asleep?"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Or, do the people of those towns feel secure that Our punishment will not come to them by daylight while they are at play?"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Do they feel secure against the design of Allah None can feel secure against the design of Allah except the utter losers."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Has it not, then, become plain to those who have inherited the earth in the wake of the former generations that, had We so willed, We could have afflicted them for their sins, (they, however, are heedless to basic facts and so) We seal their hearts so that they hear nothing."/>
		<aya index="101" text="To those [earlier] communities - some of whose stories We relate to you - there had indeed come Messengers with clear proofs, but they would not believe what they had once rejected as false. Thus it is that Allah seals the hearts of those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="102" text="We did not find most of them true to their covenants; indeed We found most of them to he transgressors."/>
		<aya index="103" text="After those We sent forth Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his nobles, but they dealt with Our signs unjustly. Observe, then, what happened to the mischief-makers."/>
		<aya index="104" text="And Moses said: 'O Pharaoh! I am a Messenger from the Lord of the universe."/>
		<aya index="105" text="And it behoves me to say nothing about Allah except what is true. I have come to you with a clear sign of having been sent from your Lord. So let the Children of Israel go with me.'"/>
		<aya index="106" text="Pharaoh said: if you have brought a sign, then bring it forth if you are truthful.'"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Thereupon Moses threw his rod, and suddenly it was a veritable serpent."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Then he drew out his hand, and it appeared luminous to all beholders."/>
		<aya index="109" text="The elders of Pharaoh's people said: 'Surely this man is a skilful magician"/>
		<aya index="110" text="who seeks to drive you out from your land. What would you have us do?'"/>
		<aya index="111" text="Then they advised Pharaoh: 'Put off Moses and his brother for a while, and send forth heralds to your cities"/>
		<aya index="112" text="to summon every skilful magician to your presence.'"/>
		<aya index="113" text="And the magicians came to Pharaoh and said: 'Shall we have a reward if we win?'"/>
		<aya index="114" text="Pharaoh replied: 'Certainly, and you shall be among those who are near to me.'"/>
		<aya index="115" text="Then they said: 'O Moses, will you [first] throw your rod, or shall we throw?'"/>
		<aya index="116" text="Moses said: 'You throw.' So when they threw [their rods], they enchanted the eyes of the people, and struck them with awe, and produced a mighty sorcery."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Then We directed Moses: 'Now you throw your rod.' And lo! it swallowed up all their false devices."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Thus was the truth established, and their doings proved in vain."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Pharaoh and his men were defeated and put to shame,"/>
		<aya index="120" text="and the magicians flung themselves prostrate,"/>
		<aya index="121" text="saying: 'We believe in the Lord of the universe,"/>
		<aya index="122" text="the Lord of Moses and Aaron.'"/>
		<aya index="123" text="Pharaoh said: 'What! Do you believe before you have my permission? Surely this is a plot you have contrived to drive out the rulers from the capital. So you shall see,"/>
		<aya index="124" text="I shall cut off your hands and feet on the opposite sides, and then crucify you all.'"/>
		<aya index="125" text="They replied: 'We shall surely return to our Lord."/>
		<aya index="126" text="Will you punish us just because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us? Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance and cause us to die as those who have submitted [to You].'"/>
		<aya index="127" text="The elders of Pharaoh's people said: 'Will you leave alone Moses and his people to spread mischief in the land, and forsake you and your gods?' Pharaoh replied: 'We will kill their male children and spare their female ones. For indeed we hold irresistible sway over them.'"/>
		<aya index="128" text="Moses said to his people: 'Seek help from Allah and be steadfast. The earth is Allah's, He bestows it on those of His servants He chooses. The end of things belongs to the God-fearing.'"/>
		<aya index="129" text="The people of Moses replied: 'We were oppressed before your coming to us and after it.' Moses said: 'Your Lord will soon destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land. Then He will see how you act.'"/>
		<aya index="130" text="We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with hard times and with poor harvest that they may heed."/>
		<aya index="131" text="But whenever prosperity came their way, they said: 'This is our due.' And whatever hardship befell them, they attributed it to the misfortune of Moses and those who followed him. Surely, their misfortune had been decreed by Allah - but most of them do not know that."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And they said to Moses: 'Whatever sign you might produce before us in order to enchant us, we are not going to believe you.'"/>
		<aya index="133" text="Then We afflicted them with a great flood and locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and the blood. All these were distinct signs and yet they remained haughty. They were a wicked people."/>
		<aya index="134" text="Each time a scourge struck them they, said: 'O Moses! Pray for us to your Lord on the strength of the prophethood He has bestowed upon you. Surely, if you remove this scourge from us, we will truly believe in you, and will let the Children of Israel go with you.'"/>
		<aya index="135" text="But when We removed the scourge from them until a term - a term which they were bound to reach - they at once broke their promise."/>
		<aya index="136" text="So We inflicted Our retribution on them, and caused them to drown in the sea because they gave the lie to Our signs and were heedless of them."/>
		<aya index="137" text="And We made those who had been persecuted inherit the eastern and western lands which We had blessed. Thus your Lord's gracious promise was fulfilled to the Children of Israel, for they had endured with patience; and We destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people had wrought, and all that they had built."/>
		<aya index="138" text="And We led the Children of Israel across the sea; and then they came upon a people who were devoted to the worship of their idols. They said: 'O Moses, make for us a god even as they have gods.' Moses said: 'You are indeed an ignorant people.'"/>
		<aya index="139" text="The way these people follow is bound to lead to destruction; and all their works are vain."/>
		<aya index="140" text="Moses said: 'Should I seek any god for you other than Allah although it is He who has exalted you above all?'"/>
		<aya index="141" text="And call to mind when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who perpetrated on you a terrible torment, putting your males to death and sparing your females. Surely in it there was an awesome trial for you from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="142" text="And We appointed for Moses thirty nights, to which We added ten, whereby the term of forty nights set by his Lord was fulfilled. And Moses said to Aaron, his brother: 'Take my place among my people, act righteously, and do not follow the path of those who create mischief.'"/>
		<aya index="143" text="And when Moses came at Our appointment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said: 'O my Lord! Reveal Yourself to me, that I may look upon You!' He replied: 'Never can you see Me. However, behold this mount; if it remains firm in its place, only then you will be able to see Me.' And as soon as his Lord unveiled His glory to the mount, He crushed it into fine dust, and Moses fell down in a swoon. And when he recovered, he said: 'Glory be to You! To You I turn in repentance, and I am the foremost among those who believe.'"/>
		<aya index="144" text="He said: 'O Moses! I have indeed preferred you to all others by virtue of the Message I have entrusted to you and by virtue of My speaking to you. Hold fast therefore, to whatever I have granted you, and give thanks.'"/>
		<aya index="145" text="And We ordained for Moses in the Tablets all manner of admonition, and instruction concerning all things, and said to him: Hold to these, with all your strength. and bid your people to follow them in accord with their best understanding. I shall soon show you the habitation of the wicked."/>
		<aya index="146" text="I shall turn away from My signs those who, without any right, behaved haughtily in the earth, even if they may, witness each and every, sign, they shall not believe therein. And even if they see the right path, they shall still not follow it; but if they see the path of error. they shall choose it for their path. This is because they rejected Our signs as false and were heedless to them."/>

		<aya index="37" text="and build the Ark under Our eyes and Our direction. And do not supplicate Me concerning those who have engaged in wrong-doing. They are doomed to be drowned."/>
		<aya index="38" text="As Noah was building the Ark, whenever the leading men of his nation passed by him, they would scoff at him. He said: 'If you scoff at us, we too scoff at you in like manner."/>
		<aya index="39" text="You will come to know who will be struck by a humiliating chastisement, and who will be subjected to an unceasing torment."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Thus it was until Our command came to pass and the oven boiled over. We said: 'Take into the Ark a pair of every species; and take your own family except those who have already been declared (as unworthy); and also take everyone who believes. But those who, along with him, had believed were indeed just a few."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Noah said: ' Embark in it. In the name of Allah is its sailing and its anchorage. My Lord is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="42" text="The Ark sailed along with them amid mountain-like waves. Noah, spotting his son at a distance, called out to him: 'My son. embark with us. and do not be with the unbelievers.'"/>
		<aya index="43" text="The son replied: 'I will go to a mountain for refuge and it will save me from the water.' Noah said: 'None can save anyone today from the command of Allah except those on whom He may have mercy.' Thereupon a wave swept in between the two and he was drowned."/>
		<aya index="44" text="And the command was given: 'Earth! Swallow up your water'; and: 'Heaven! Abate!' So the water subsided, the command was fulfilled, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi, and it was said: 'Away with the wrong-doing folk!'"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And Noah called out to his Lord, saying: 'My Lord! My son is of my family. Surely Your promise is true, and You are the greatest of those who judge."/>
		<aya index="46" text="In response Noah was told: 'Most certainly he is not of your family; verily he is of unrighteous conduct. So do not ask of Me for that concerning which you have no knowledge. I admonish you never to act like the ignorant ones."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Noah said: 'My Lord! I take refuge with You that I should ask you for that concerning which I have no knowledge. And if You do not forgive me and do not show mercy to me, I shall be among the losers."/>
		<aya index="48" text="It was said: 'Noah! Disembark, with Our peace, and with blessings upon you and upon those who are with you. There are also people whom We shall allow to enjoy themselves for a while, and then a painful chastisement from Us shall afflict them.'"/>
		<aya index="49" text="We reveal to you these accounts of matters that are beyond the reach of human perception. Neither you nor your people knew about them before this. Be, then, patient. Surely, the good end is for the God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And to 'Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said: 'My people! Serve Allah: you have no god save Him. (In attributing partners to Allah) you have merely been fabricating lies."/>
		<aya index="51" text="My people! I seek no reward from you for my work. My reward lies only with Him Who created me. Do you not understand anything?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="My people! Ask your Lord for forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. He will shower abundant rains upon you from the heaven, and will add strength to your strength. Do not turn away as those given to guilt.'"/>
		<aya index="53" text="They said: 'O Hud! You have not brought to us any clear evidence, and we are not going to forsake our gods merely because you say so. We are not going to believe you."/>
		<aya index="54" text="All we can say is that some god of ours has afflicted you with evil.. Hud said: 'Indeed I take Allah as my witness, and you too to be my witnesses that I have nothing to do with your associating with Allah"/>
		<aya index="55" text="others than Him in His divinity. So conspire against me, all of you, and give me no respite."/>
		<aya index="56" text="I have put my trust in Allah, Who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no moving creature which He does not hold by its forelock. Surely, My Lord is on the straight path."/>
		<aya index="57" text="If you, then, turn away (from the truth), know that I have delivered the message with which I was sent to you. Now my Lord will set up another people in place of you and you shall in no way be able to harm Him. Surely my Lord keeps a watch over everything.'"/>
		<aya index="58" text="And when Our com-mand came to pass, We delivered Hud, together with those who shared his faith, out of special mercy from Us. We delivered them from a woeful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Such were 'Ad. They repudiated the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His Messengers, and followed the bidding of every tyrannical enemy of the truth."/>
		<aya index="60" text="They were pursued by a curse in this world, and so will they be on the Day of Judgement. Lo! 'Ad disbelieved in the Lord. Lo! ruined are 'Ad, the people of Hud."/>
		<aya index="61" text="And to Thamud We sent their brother Sali'h. He said: 'My people! Serve Allah; you have no god other than Him. He brought you into being out of the earth, and has made you dwell in it. So ask Him to forgive you, and do turn towards Him in repentance. Indeed My Lord is near, responsive to prayers."/>
		<aya index="62" text="They said: 'O Salih! Until now you were one of those among us on whom we placed great hopes. Now, would you forbid us to worship what our forefathers were wont to worship? Indeed we are in disquieting doubt about what you are calling us to."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Salih said: 'My people! What do you think? If I had a clear evidence from my Lord, and then He also bestowed His mercy upon me, who will rescue me from the punishment of Allah if I still disobey Him? You can only make me lose even more."/>
		<aya index="64" text="My people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you. So let her pasture on Allah's earth, and do not hurt her or else some chastisement - which is near at hand -should overtake you.'"/>
		<aya index="65" text="But they slaughtered her. Thereupon Salih warned them: 'Enjoy yourselves in your homes for a maximum of three days. This is a promise which shall not be belied.'"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Then, when Our command came to pass, We saved Salih and those who shared his faith through Our special mercy, from the disgrace of that day. Truly Your Lord is All-Strong, All-Mighty."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And the Blast overtook those who were wont to do wrong, and then they lay lifeless in their homes"/>
		<aya index="68" text="as though they had never lived there before. Oh, verily the Thamud denied their Lord! Oh, the Thamud were destroyed."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Indeed Our messengers came to Abraham, bearing glad tidings. They greeted him with 'peace', and Abraham answered back to them 'peace', and hurriedly brought to them a roasted calf."/>
		<aya index="70" text="When he perceived that their hands could not reach it, he mistrusted them, and felt afraid of them. They said: 'Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot."/>
		<aya index="71" text="And Abraham's wife was standing by and on hearing this she laughed. And We gave her the good news of (the birth of) Isaac, and after Isaac, of Jacob."/>
		<aya index="72" text="She said: 'Woe is me! Shall I bear a child now that I am an old woman and my husband is well advanced in years. This is indeed strange!'"/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said: 'Do you wonder at Allah's decree? Allah's mercy and His blessings be upon you, O people of the house. Surely, He is Praiseworthy, Glorious.'"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Thus when fear had left Abraham and the good news had been conveyed to him, he began to dispute with Us concerning the people of Lot."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Surely Abraham was forbearing, tenderhearted and oft-turning to Allah."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Thereupon (Our angels) said to him: 'O Abraham! Desist from this, for indeed your Lord's command has come; and a chastisement which cannot be averted is about to befall them.' words literally suggest; the purpose is merely to express a sense of wonder."/>
		<aya index="77" text="And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was perturbed by their coming and felt troubled on their account, and said: 'This is a distressing day."/>
		<aya index="78" text="And his people came to him rushing. Before this they were wont to commit evil deeds. Lot said: 'My people! Here are my daughters; they are purer for you. Have fear of Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not even one right-minded person in your midst?'"/>
		<aya index="79" text="They said: 'Surely you already know that we have nothing to do with your daughters. You also know well what we want.'"/>
		<aya index="80" text="He said: 'Would that I had the strength to set you straight, or could seek refuge in some powerful support.'"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Thereupon the angels said: 'O Lot! We indeed are messengers of your Lord. And your people will in no way be able to hurt you. So depart with your family in a part of the night and let no one of you turn around excepting your wife (who shall not go); for what will befall them shall also befall her. In the morning their promised hour will come. Is not the morning near?'"/>
		<aya index="82" text="And when Our command came to pass, We turned the town upside down, and rained on it stones of baked clay, one on another,"/>
		<aya index="83" text="marked from your Lord. Nor is the punishment far off from the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And to (the people of) Midian We sent their brother Shu'ayb. He said: 'My people! Serve Allah; you have no god other than Him. And do not diminish the measure and weight. Indeed I see that you are prospering now, but I fear for you the chastisement of an encompassing day in the future."/>
		<aya index="85" text="My people! Give full measure and weight with justice, do not diminish the goods of others, and do not go about creating corruption in the land."/>
		<aya index="86" text="The gains that Allah lets you retain are better for you, if you indeed believe. In any case, I have not been appointed a keeper over you."/>
		<aya index="87" text="They replied: 'O Shu'ayb! Does your Prayer enjoin upon you that we should forsake the deities whom our forefathers worshipped, or that we should give up using our wealth as we please? Do you fancy that you, and only you, are forbearing and right-directed?'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="Shu'ayb said: 'My people! What do you think? If I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has also provided me a handsome provision from Himself -(should I be ungrateful to Him and share your error and iniquity?) Nor do I desire to act contrary to what I admonish you. I desire nothing but to set things right as far as I can. My succour is only with Allah. In Him have I put my trust, and to Him do I always turn."/>
		<aya index="89" text="My people! Let not your opposition to me lead you to guilt that would bring upon you the chastisement that struck earlier the people of Noah, and the people of Hud, and the people of Salih. And the land of the people of Lot is not far from you!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Seek the forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Ever Merciful, Most Loving."/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: 'O Shu'ayb! We do not understand much of what you say. Indeed we see you weak in our midst. Were it not for your kinsmen, we would surely have stoned you for you have no strength to overpower us."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Shu'ayb said: 'My people! Are my kinsmen mightier with you than Allah that you (hold the kinsmen in awe while) you cast Allah behind your back? Surely my Lord encompasses all what you do."/>
		<aya index="93" text="My people! Go on working according to your way and I will keep working (according to mine). Soon you will come to know who will be afflicted by a humiliating chastisement, and who is proved a liar. And watch, I shall also watch with you.'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when Our command came to pass, We delivered Shu'ayb and those who shared his faith, through Our mercy, and the Blast seized those who were engaged in wrong-doing, so they lay lifeless in their homes"/>
		<aya index="95" text="as though they had never dwelt in them before. Lo! Away with (the people of) Midian, even as the Thamud were done away with!"/>
		<aya index="96" text="And indeed We sent Moses with Our signs and with a clear authority"/>
		<aya index="97" text="to Pharaoh and his nobles. But they obeyed the command of Pharaoh even though Pharaoh's command was not rightly-directed."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He shall stand at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will bring them down to the Fire. What a wretched destination to be led to!"/>
		<aya index="99" text="They were pursued by a curse in this world and so will they be on the Day of Resurrection. What an evil reward will they receive!"/>
		<aya index="100" text="That is an account of some towns which We recount to you. Of them some are still standing and some have been mown down."/>
		<aya index="101" text="We did not wrong them; it is rather they who wronged themselves. And when the command of your Lord came to pass, the gods besides Allah whom they had called upon, did not avail them in the least. They added nothing to them except ruin."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Such is the seizing of your Lord that when He does seize the towns immersed in wrong-doing, His seizing is painful, terrible."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Surely in that is a sign for him who fears the chastisement of the Hereafter. That will be a Day when all men shall be mustered together; that will be a Day when whatever happens shall be witnessed by all."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Nor shall We withhold it except till an appointed term."/>
		<aya index="105" text="And when the appointed Day comes, no one shall even dare to speak except by the leave of Allah. Then some will be declared wretched, others blessed."/>
		<aya index="106" text="As for the wretched, they shall be in the Fire, and in it they shall sigh and groan."/>
		<aya index="107" text="They shall abide in it as long as the heavens and the earth endure, unless your Lord may will otherwise. Surely your Lord does whatsoever He wills."/>
		<aya index="108" text="And as for those who are blessed, they shall abide in the Garden as long as the heavens and the earth endure, unless your Lord may will otherwise. They shall enjoy an unceasing gift."/>
		<aya index="109" text="[O Prophet!] Have no doubt about what they worship. For they worship what their fathers worshipped before. And (yet) We shall grant them their due portion in full, diminishing of it nothing."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And We certainly gave Moses the Book before, and there arose disagreements about it (even as there are disagreements now about the Book revealed to you). Had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have long been decided between them. Indeed they are in a disquieting doubt about it."/>
		<aya index="111" text="Surely your Lord will recompense all to the full for their deeds. For indeed He is well aware of all what they do."/>
		<aya index="112" text="So remain, (O Muhammad), you and those who have returned with you (to the fold of faith and obedience from unbelief and rebellion) steadfast (in adhering to the straight way) as you were commanded. And do not exceed the limits of (service to Allah). For certainly He is aware of all what you do."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And do not incline towards the wrong-doers lest the Fire might seize you and you will have none as your protector against Allah; and then you will not be helped from anywhere."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And establish the Prayer at the two ends of the day and in the first hours of the night. Indeed the good deeds drive away the evil deeds. This is a Reminder to those who are mindful of Allah."/>
		<aya index="115" text="And be patient; for indeed Allah never lets the reward of those who do good go to waste."/>
		<aya index="116" text="Why were there not, out of the generations that passed away before you, righteous men who would forbid others from causing corruption on the earth?

	<sura index="12" name="يوسف">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif. Lam. Ra'. These are the verses of a Book that clearly expounds the truth."/>
		<aya index="2" text="We have revealed it as a Recitation in Arabic that you may fully understand."/>
		<aya index="3" text="(O Muhammad), by revealing the Qur'an to you We narrate to you in the best manner the stories of the past although before this narration you were utterly unaware of them."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Call to mind when Joseph said to his father: &quot;My father! I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrating themselves before me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="5" text="His father said: &quot;My son! Do not relate your dream to your brothers lest they hatch a plot to harm you. Indeed Satan is man's open enemy."/>
		<aya index="6" text="(As you have seen in the dream), so will your Lord choose you (for His task) and will impart to you the comprehension of the deeper meaning of things and will bestow the full measure of His favour upon you and upon the house of Jacob even as He earlier bestowed it in full measure upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your Lord is All- Knowing, All-Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="7" text="Verily in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are many signs for those who inquire (about the truth)."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And call to mind when the brothers of Joseph conferred together and said: &quot;Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, although we are a group of so many. Our father is clearly mistaken."/>
		<aya index="9" text="So either kill Joseph or cast him into some distant land so that your father's attention may become exclusively yours. And after so doing become righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="10" text="Thereupon one of them said: &quot;Do not kill Joseph, but if you are bent upon doing something, cast him down to the bottom of some dark pit, perhaps some caravan passing by will take him out of it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="11" text="After so deciding they said to their father: &quot;Why is it that you do not trust us regarding Joseph although we are his true well-wishers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Send him out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play while we will be there, standing guard over him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Their father answered: &quot;It grieves me indeed that you should take him with you for I fear that some wolf might eat him up while you are negligent of him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="14" text="They said: &quot;Should a wolf eat him, despite the presence of our strong group, we would indeed be a worthless lot!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="So when they went away with Joseph and decided to cast him in the bottom of the dark pit, We revealed to Joseph: &quot;Surely a time will come when you will remind them of their deed. They know nothing about the consequence of what they are doing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="At nightfall they came to their father weeping"/>
		<aya index="17" text="and said: &quot;Father! We went racing with one another and left Joseph behind with our things, and then a wolf came and ate him up. We know that you will not believe us howsoever truthful we might be.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="And they brought Joseph's shirt, stained with false blood. Seeing this their father exclaimed: &quot;Nay (this is not true); rather your evil souls have made it easy for you to commit a heinous act. So I will bear this patiently, and in good grace. It is Allah's help alone that I seek against your fabrication.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="And a caravan came, and they sent their water drawer to draw water. As he let down his bucket in the well he (observed Joseph) and cried out: &quot;This is good news. There is a boy.&quot; They concealed him, considering him as part of their merchandise, while Allah was well aware of what they did."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Later they sold him for a paltry sum - just a few dirhams; they did not care to obtain a higher price."/>
		<aya index="21" text="The man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: &quot;Take good care of him, possibly he might be of benefit to us or we might adopt him as a son.&quot; Thus We found a way for Joseph to become established in that land and in order that We might teach him to comprehend the deeper meaning of things. Allah has full power to implement His design although most people do not know that."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when Joseph reached the age of maturity, We granted him judgement and knowledge. Thus do We reward those who do good."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And it so happened that the lady in whose house Joseph was living, sought to tempt him to herself, and one day bolting the doors she said: &quot;Come on now!&quot; Joseph answered: &quot;May Allah grant me refuge! My Lord has provided an honourable abode for me (so how can I do something so evil)? Such wrong-doers never prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="And she advanced towards him, and had Joseph not perceived a sign from his Lord he too would have advanced towards her. Thus was Joseph shown a sign from his Lord that We might avert from him all evil and indecency, for indeed he was one of Our chosen servants."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then both of them rushed to the door, each seeking to get ahead of the other, and she tore Joseph's shirt from behind. Then both of them found the husband of the lady at the door. Seeing him she said: &quot;What should be the punishment of him who has foul designs on your wife except that he should be imprisoned or subjected to painful chastisement?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Joseph said: &quot;It is she who was trying to tempt me to herself.&quot; And a witness belonging to her own household testified (on grounds of circumstantial evidence): &quot;If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar."/>
		<aya index="27" text="But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="So when the husband saw Joseph's shirt torn from behind he exclaimed: &quot;Surely, this is one of the tricks of you women; your tricks are indeed great."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Joseph, disregard this. And you - woman - ask forgiveness for your sin, for indeed it is you who has been at fault.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="And some ladies in the city began to say: &quot;The chief's wife, violently in love with her houseboy, is out to tempt him. We think she is clearly mistaken.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="Hearing of their sly talk the chief's wife sent for those ladies, and arranged for them a banquet, and got ready couches, and gave each guest a knife. Then, while they were cutting and eating the fruit, she signalled Joseph: &quot;Come out to them.&quot; When the ladies saw him they were so struck with admiration that they cut their hands, exclaiming: &quot;Allah preserve us. This is no mortal human. This is nothing but a noble angel!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="She said: &quot;So now you see! This is the one regarding whom you reproached me. Indeed I tried to tempt him to myself but he held back, although if he were not to follow my order, he would certainly be imprisoned and humiliated.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Joseph said: &quot;My Lord! I prefer imprisonment to what they ask me to do. And if You do not avert from me the guile of these women, I will succumb to their attraction and lapse into ignorance.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="Thereupon his Lord granted his prayer, and averted their guile from him. Surely He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Then it occurred to them to cast Joseph into prison for a while even though they had seen clear signs (of Joseph's innocence and of the evil ways of their ladies)."/>
		<aya index="36" text="And with Joseph two other slaves entered the prison. One of them said: &quot;I saw myself pressing wine in a dream&quot;; and the other said: &quot;I saw myself carrying bread on my head of which the birds were eating.&quot; Both said: &quot;Tell us what is its interpretation; for we consider you to be one of those who do good.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Joseph said: &quot;I will inform you about the interpretation of the dreams before the arrival of the food that is sent to you. This knowledge is part of what I have been taught by my Lord. I have renounced the way of those who do not believe in Allah, and who deny the Hereafter,"/>
		<aya index="38" text="and I have adopted the way of my forefathers - Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It is not for us to associate any with Allah in His Divinity. It is out of Allah's grace upon us and upon mankind (that He did not require of us to serve any other than Allah), and yet most people do not give thanks."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Fellow-prisoners! Is it better that there be diverse lords, or just Allah, the One, the Irresistible?"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Those whom you serve beside Him are merely idle names that you and your fathers have fabricated, without Allah sending down any sanction for them. All authority to govern rests only with Allah. He has commanded that you serve none but Him. This is the Right Way of life, though most people are altogether unaware."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Fellow-prisoners! (This is the interpretation of your dreams): one of you will serve wine to his lord (the king of Egypt). As for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat of his head. The question concerning what you asked has thus been decided.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="And Joseph said to the one of the two prisoners who he knew would be set free: &quot;Mention me in your lord's presence.&quot; But Satan caused him to forget mentioning this to his lord (the ruler of Egypt) and so Joseph languished in prison for several years."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And once the king said: &quot;I have dreamt that there are seven fat cows and seven lean cows are devouring them, and there are seven fresh green ears of corn and seven others dry and withered. My nobles! Tell me what is the interpretation of this dream, if you are well-versed in interpretation of dreams.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="44" text="They said: &quot;These are confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Then of the two prisoners, the one who had been set free, now remembered, after the lapse of a long period, what Joseph had said. He said: &quot;I will tell you the interpretation of this dream; just send me (to Joseph in prison).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Then he went to Joseph and said to him: &quot;Joseph, O truthfulness incarnate, tell the true meaning of the dream in which seven fat cows are devoured by seven lean ones; and there are seven green ears of corn and seven others dry and withered so that I may return to the people and they may learn.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Joseph said: &quot;You will cultivate consecutively for seven years. Leave in the ears all that you have harvested except the little out of which you may eat."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Then there will follow seven years of great hardship in which you will eat up all you have stored earlier, except the little that you may set aside."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Then there will come a year when people will be helped by plenty of rain and they will press (grapes).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="The king said: &quot;Bring this man to me.&quot; But when the royal messenger came to Joseph he said: &quot;Go back to your master and ask him about the case of the women who had cut their hands. Surely my Lord has full knowledge of their guile.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Thereupon the king asked the women: &quot;What happened when you sought to tempt Joseph?&quot; They said: &quot;Allah forbid! We found no evil in him.&quot; The chief's wife said: &quot;Now the truth has come to light. It was I who sought to tempt him. He is indeed truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Joseph said: &quot;I did this so that he [i.e. the chief) may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not allow the design of the treacherous to succeed."/>

		<aya index="58" text="And Joseph's brothers came to Egypt and presented themselves before him. He recognized them, but they did not know him."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And when he had prepared for them their provisions, Joseph said: &quot;Bring to me your other brother from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure and am most hospitable?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="If you do not bring him to me, you shall have no corn from me; and do not even attempt to come close to me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="They said: &quot;We will surely try to prevail over our father to send him. Be sure we shall do so.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="And Joseph said to his servants: &quot;Put surreptitiously in their packs the goods they had given in exchange for corn.&quot; Joseph did so expecting that they would find it when they returned home. Feeling grateful for this generosity, they might be inclined to return to him."/>
		<aya index="63" text="When they returned to their father they said: &quot;Father! We have been denied further supply of corn. So send with us our brother that we may bring the supplies. We shall be responsible for his protection.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="The father said: &quot;Shall I trust you with regard to him as I had trusted you earlier with regard to his brother? Allah is the Best Protector and is the Most Merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="And when they opened their things they found that their goods had been given back to them. Thereupon they cried: &quot;Father! What else would we desire? Look, even our goods have been given back to us, so we shall go now and bring supplies for our family, we shall protect our brother, and bring another camel-load of corn. That additional supply will be easily secured.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Their father said: &quot;I shall never send him with you until you give me a solemn promise in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you yourselves are surrounded.&quot; Then after they had given him their solemn promise, he said. &quot;Allah watches over what we have said.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="And he enjoined them: &quot;My sons! Do not enter the city by one gate; rather enter it by different gates. I can be of no help to you against Allah. Allah's command alone prevails. In Him have I put my trust and in Him should all those who have faith put their trust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="And it so happened that when they entered the city (by many gates) as their father had directed them, this precautionary measure proved ineffective against Allah's will. There was an uneasiness in Jacob's soul which he so tried to remove. Surely he was possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that We bestowed upon him. But most people do not know the truth of the matter."/>
		<aya index="69" text="When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother aside to himself and said: &quot;Verily I am your own brother Joseph; so do not grieve over the manner they have treated you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Then, while Joseph was having their provisions loaded, he put his drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag. And then a herald cried: &quot;Travellers, you are thieves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="Turning back they asked: &quot;What have you lost?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="The officials said: &quot;We have lost the king's cup.&quot; (And their chief added): &quot;He who brings it shall have a camel-load of provisions, I guarantee that.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said: &quot;By Allah, you certainly know that we did not come to act corruptly in this land, nor are we those who steal.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="The officials said: &quot;If you are lying, what will be the penalty for him who has stolen?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="They replied: &quot;He in whose saddlebag the cup is found, he himself shall be its recompense.&quot; Thus do we punish the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Then Joseph began searching their bags before searching his own brother's bag. Then he brought forth the drinking-cup from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive to support Joseph. He had no right, according to the religion of the king (i.e. the law of Egypt), to take his brother, unless Allah so willed. We exalt whomsoever We will over others by several degrees. And above all those who know is the One Who truly knows."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They said: &quot;No wonder that he steals for a brother of his stole before.&quot; But Joseph kept his reaction to himself without disclosing the truth to them. He merely said to himself: &quot;You are an evil lot. Allah knows well the truth of the accusation that you are making against me (to my face).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said: &quot;O powerful chief (al-aziz)! His father is an age-stricken man, (and in order that he may not suffer) seize one of us in his stead. We indeed consider you an excellent person.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="Joseph said: &quot;Allah forbid that we should seize any except him with whom we found our good. Were we to do so, we would surely be one of the wrong-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="Then, when they had despaired of Joseph they went to a corner and counselled together. The eldest of them said: &quot;Do you not know that your father has taken a solemn promise from you in the name of Allah, and you failed in your duty towards Joseph? So I will not depart from this land until my father permits me, or Allah pronounces His judgement in my favour. He is the best of those who judge.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="So go back to your father and tell him: &quot;Father! Your son has certainly been guilty of stealing. We did not see him stealing but testify according to what we know, and obviously we had no power to keep watch over that what is altogether hidden from us."/>
		<aya index="82" text="You may inquire of the dwellers of the city where we were, and of the people of the caravan with whom we travelled. We are altogether truthful in what we say.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="The father heard the narration and said: &quot;(All that is untrue). But your souls have made it easy for you to engage in a heinous act. So, I will be graciously patient even at this. Allah may well bring them all back to me. He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="Then he turned his back to them, and said: &quot;O my grief for Joseph!&quot; His eyes whitened with grief and he was choked up with sorrow trying to suppress his grief."/>
		<aya index="85" text="The sons said: &quot;By Allah! You will continue to remember Joseph until you will either consume yourself with grief, or will die.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="He said: &quot;I will address my sorrow and grief only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know."/>
		<aya index="87" text="My sons! Go and try to find out about Joseph and his brother and do not despair of Allah's mercy. Verily only the unbelievers despair of Allah's mercy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="On going to Egypt they presented themselves to Joseph and said to him: &quot;O chief! We and our family are struck with distress and have brought only a paltry sum. So give us corn in full measure, and give it to us in charity. Allah rewards those who are charitable.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="When Joseph heard this (he could not hold himself and said): &quot;Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They exclaimed: &quot;Are you indeed Joseph?&quot; He said: &quot;Yes, I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah has surely been gracious to us. Indeed whoever fears Allah and remains patient, Allah does not allow the reward of such people to go to waste.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: &quot;We swear by Allah! Indeed Allah has chosen you in preference to us and we were truly guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="He replied: &quot;No blame lies with you today. May Allah forgive you. He is the Most Merciful of all those that are merciful."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father's face. He will regain his sight. And bring to me all your family.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="And as the caravan set out (from Egypt), their father said (in Canaan): &quot;Indeed I smell the fragrance of Joseph. I say so although you may think that I am doting.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="They said: &quot;Surely you are still in your same old craze.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="And when the bearer of good news came he threw Joseph's shirt over Jacob's face, whereupon he regained his sight, and said: &quot;Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="They said: &quot;Father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins; we were truly guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said: &quot;I shall pray to my Lord for your forgiveness, for He, and indeed He alone, is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="And when they went to Joseph, he took his parents aside and said (to the members of his family): &quot;Enter the city now, and if Allah wills, you shall be secure.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="100" text="And after they had entered the city, Joseph raised his parents to the throne beside himself, and they (involuntarily) bowed in prostration before him. Joseph said: &quot;Father! This is the fulfilment of the vision I had before - one that My Lord has caused to come true. He was kind to me when He rescued me from the prison, and brought you from the desert after Satan had stirred discord between me and my brothers. Certainly my Lord is Subtle in the fulfilment of His will; He is All-Knowing, All-Wise."/>
		<aya index="101" text="My Lord! You have bestowed dominion upon me and have taught me to comprehend the depths of things. O Creator of heavens and earth! You are my Guardian in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die in submission to You, and join me, in the end, with the righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="102" text="(O Muhammad), this is part of news from the Unseen that We reveal to you for you were not present with them when Joseph's brothers jointly resolved on a plot."/>

		<aya index="107" text="Do they, then, feel secure that an overwhelming chastisement shall not visit them, and the Hour shall not suddenly come upon them without their even perceiving it?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Tell them plainly: &quot;This is my way: I call you to Allah, on the basis of clear perception - both I and those who follow me. Allah - Glory be to Him - is free of every imperfection. I have nothing to do with those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="109" text="The Messengers whom We raised before you, (O Muhammad), and to whom We sent down revelations, were only human beings, and were from among those living in earthly habitations. Have these people not travelled in the earth that they may observe the end of their predecessors? Certainly the abode of the Hereafter is much better for those (who accepted the call of the Messengers and) acted in a God-fearing manner. Will you still not act with good sense?"/>
		<aya index="110" text="(It also happened with the earlier Messengers that for long they preached and people paid no heed) until the Messengers despaired of their people, and the people also fancied that they had been told lies (by the Messengers), then suddenly Our help came to the Messengers.

		<aya index="111" text="Certainly in the stories of the bygone people there is a lesson for people of understanding.

		<aya index="8" text="In the ultimate, We shall reduce all that is on the earth to a barren plain."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Do you think that the people of the Cave and the Inscription were one of Our wondrous signs?"/>
		<aya index="10" text="When those youths sought refuge in the Cave and said: &quot;Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and provide for us rectitude in our affairs.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="11" text="We lulled them to sleep in that cave for a number of years"/>
		<aya index="12" text="and then roused them so that We might see which of the two parties could best tell the length of their stay."/>
		<aya index="13" text="We narrate to you their true story. They were a party of young men who had faith in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance"/>
		<aya index="14" text="and strengthened their hearts when they stood up and proclaimed: &quot;Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We shall call upon no other god beside Him; (for if we did so), we shall be uttering a blasphemy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="(Then they conferred among themselves and said): &quot;These men, our own people, have taken others as gods beside Him: why do they not bring any clear evidence that they indeed are gods? Who can be more unjust than he who foists a lie on Allah?"/>
		<aya index="16" text="And now that you have dissociated yourselves from them and from whatever they worship beside Allah, go and seek refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and will provide for you the means for the disposal of your affairs.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="17" text="Had you seen them in the Cave it would have appeared to you that when the sun rose, it moved away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it turned away from them to the left, while they remained in a spacious hollow in the Cave. This is one of the Signs of Allah. Whomsoever Allah guides, he alone is led aright; and whomsoever Allah lets go astray, you will find for him no guardian to direct him."/>
		<aya index="18" text="On seeing them you would fancy them to be awake though they were asleep; and We caused them to turn their sides to their right and to their left, and their dog sat stretching out its forelegs on the threshold of the Cave. Had you looked upon them you would have certainly fled away from them, their sight filling you with terror."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Likewise, We roused them in a miraculous way that they might question one another. One of them asked: &quot;How long did you remain (in this state)?&quot; The others said: &quot;We remained so for a day or part of a day.&quot; Then they said: &quot;Your Lord knows better how long we remained in this state. Now send one of you to the city with this coin of yours and let him see who has the best food, and let him buy some provisions from there. Let him be cautious and not inform anyone of our whereabouts."/>

		<aya index="21" text="Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city so that they might know that Allah's promise is true, and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass. But instead of giving thought to this, they disputed with one another concerning the People of the Cave, some saying: &quot;Build a wall over them. Their Lord alone knows best about them.&quot; But those who prevailed over their affairs said: &quot;We shall build a place of worship over them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Some will say concerning them: &quot;They were three and their dog, the fourth&quot;; and some will say: &quot;They were five, and their dog, the sixth&quot; -- all this being merely guesswork; and still others will say: &quot;They were seven, and their dog, the eighth.&quot; Say: &quot;My Lord knows their number best. Only a few know their correct number. So do not dispute concerning their number, but stick to what is evident, and do not question anyone about them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="And never say about anything: &quot;I shall certainly do this tomorrow&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="unless Allah should will it. And should you forget (and make such a statement), remember your Lord and say: &quot;I expect my Lord to guide me to what is nearer to rectitude than this.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="28" text="Keep yourself content with those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, and do not let your eyes pass beyond them. Do you seek the pomp and glitter of the world? Do not follow him whose heart We have caused to be heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his desires, and whose attitude is of excess."/>
		<aya index="29" text="And proclaim: &quot;This is the Truth from your Lord. Now let him who will, believe; and let him who will, disbelieve. We have prepared a Fire for the wrong-doers whose billowing folds encompass them. If they ask for water, they will be served with a drink like dregs of oil that will scald their faces. How dreadful a drink, and how evil an abode!"/>
		<aya index="30" text="As for those who believe and do good We shall not cause their reward to be lost."/>
		<aya index="31" text="They shall dwell in the Gardens of Eternity, beneath which streams flow.

		<aya index="32" text="(O Muhammad), propound a parable to them. There were two men of whom We bestowed upon one of the two vineyards, surrounding both of them with date-palms and putting a tillage in between."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Both the vineyards yielded abundant produce without failure and We caused a stream to flow in their midst"/>
		<aya index="34" text="so the owner had fruit in abundance and he said to his neighbour, while conversing with him: &quot;I have greater wealth than you and I am stronger than you in numbers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Then he entered his vine-yard and said, wronging himself: &quot;Surely, I do not believe that all this will ever perish."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Nor do I believe that the Hour of Resurrection will ever come to pass. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I shall find a better place than this.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="While conversing with him his neighbour exclaimed: &quot;Do you deny Him Who created you out of dust, then out of a drop of sperm, and then fashioned you into a complete man?"/>
		<aya index="38" text="As for myself, Allah alone is my Lord, and I associate none with my Lord in His Divinity."/>
		<aya index="39" text="When you entered your vineyard, why did you not say: 'Whatever Allah wills shall come to pass, for there is no power save with Allah!' If you find me less than yourself in wealth and children"/>
		<aya index="40" text="it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your vineyard, and send a calamity upon your vineyard from the heavens and it will be reduced to a barren waste,"/>
		<aya index="41" text="or the water of your vineyard will be drained deep into the ground so that you will not be able to seek it out.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="Eventually all his produce was destroyed and he began to wring his hands in sorrow at the loss of what he had spent on it, and on seeing it fallen down upon its trellises, saying: &quot;Would I had not associated anyone with my Lord in His Divinity.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="And there was no host, beside Allah, to help him, nor could he be of any help to himself."/>
		<aya index="44" text="(Then he knew) that all power of protection rests with Allah, the True One. He is the best to reward, the best to determine the end of things."/>
		<aya index="45" text="(O Prophet), propound to them the parable of the present life: it is like the vegetation of the earth which flourished luxuriantly when it mingled with the water that We sent down from the sky, but after that the same vegetation turned into stubble which the winds blew about. Allah alone has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of the world. But the deeds of lasting righteousness are the best in the sight of your Lord in reward, and far better a source of hope."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Bear in mind the Day when We shall set the mountains in motion and you will find the earth void and bare. On that Day We shall muster all men together, leaving none of them behind."/>
		<aya index="48" text="They shall be brought before your Lord, all lined up, and shall be told: &quot;Now, indeed, you have come before Us in the manner We created you in the first instance, although you thought that We shall not appoint a tryst (with Us).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="And then the Record of their deeds shall be placed before them and you will see the guilty full of fear for what it contains, and will say: &quot;Woe to us! What a Record this is! It leaves nothing, big or small, but encompasses it.&quot; They will find their deeds confronting them. Your Lord wrongs no one."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And recall when We said to the angels: &quot;Prostrate yourselves before Adam&quot;; all of them fell prostrate, except Iblis. He was of the jinn and so disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you, then, take him and his progeny as your guardians rather than Me although they are your open enemies? What an evil substitute are these wrong-doers taking!"/>
		<aya index="51" text="I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor in their own creation. I do not seek the aid of those who lead people astray."/>

		<aya index="53" text="and the guilty shall behold the Fire and know that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no escape from it."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And surely We have explained matters to people in the Qur'an in diverse ways, using all manner of parables. But man is exceedingly contentious."/>
		<aya index="55" text="What is it that prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, except that they would like to be treated as the nations of yore, or that they would like to see the scourge come upon them face to face?"/>
		<aya index="56" text="We raise Messengers only to give good news and to warn. But the unbelievers resort to falsehood in order to rebut the truth with it, and scoff at My revelations and My warnings."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Who is more wicked than the man who, when he is reminded by the revelations of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets (the consequence of) the deeds wrought by his own hands? We have laid veils over their hearts lest they understand the message of the Qur'an, and We have caused heaviness in their ears. Call them as you may to the Right Path, they will not be ever guided aright."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Your Lord is All-Forgiving, full of mercy. Had He wished to take them to task for their doings, He would have hastened in sending His scourge upon them. But He has set for them a time-limit which they cannot evade."/>
		<aya index="59" text="All the townships afflicted with scourge are before your eyes. When they committed wrong, We destroyed them. For the destruction of each We had set a definite term."/>
		<aya index="60" text="(And recount to them the story of Moses) when Moses said to his servant: &quot;I will journey on until I reach the point where the two rivers meet, though I may march on for ages.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="But when they reached the point where the two rivers meet, they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the sea, as if through a tunnel."/>
		<aya index="62" text="When they had journeyed further on, Moses said to his servant: &quot;Bring us our repast. We are surely fatigued by today's journey.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="The servant said: &quot;Did you see what happened? When we betook ourselves to the rock to take rest, I forgot the fish - and it is only Satan who caused me to forget to mention it to you - so that it made its way into the sea in a strange manner.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Moses said: &quot;That is what we were looking for.&quot; So the two turned back, retracing their footsteps,"/>
		<aya index="65" text="and there they found one of Our servants upon whom We had bestowed Our mercy, and to whom We had imparted a special knowledge from Ourselves."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said to him: &quot;May l follow you that you may teach me something of the wisdom which you have been taught?&quot;"/>

		<aya index="68" text="For how can you patiently bear with something you cannot encompass in your knowledge?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Moses replied: &quot;You shall find me, if Allah wills, patient; and I shall not disobey you in anything.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="He said: &quot;Well, if you follow me, do not ask me concerning anything until I myself mention it to you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="Then the two went forth until, when they embarked on the boat, he made a hole in it, whereupon Moses exclaimed: &quot;Have you made a hole in it so as to drown the people in the boat? You have certainly done an awful thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="He replied: &quot;Did I not tell you that you will not be able to patiently bear with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="Moses said: &quot;Do not take me to task at my forgetfulness, and do not be hard on me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then the two went forth until they met a lad whom he slew, whereupon Moses exclaimed: &quot;What! Have you slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone? Surely you have done a horrible thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="He said: &quot;Did I not tell you that you will not be able to patiently bear with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Moses said: &quot;Keep me no more in your company if I question you concerning anything after this. You will then be fully justified.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Then the two went forth until when they came to a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to play host to them. They found in that town a wall that was on the verge of tumbling down, and he buttressed it, whereupon Moses said: &quot;If you had wished, you could have received payment for it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="He said: &quot;This brings me and you to a parting of ways. Now I shall explain to you the true meaning of things about which you could not remain patient."/>
		<aya index="79" text="As for the boat it belonged to some poor people who worked on the river, and I desired to damage it for beyond them lay the dominion of a king who was wont to seize every boat by force."/>
		<aya index="80" text="As for the lad, his parents were people of faith, and we feared lest he should plague them with transgression and disbelief,"/>
		<aya index="81" text="and we desired that their Lord should grant them another in his place, a son more upright and more tender hearted."/>
		<aya index="82" text="As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under it there was a treasure that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man and your Lord intended that they should come of age and then bring forth their treasure as a mercy from your Lord; I did not do this of my own bidding.

		<aya index="92" text="Then he set out on another expedition"/>
		<aya index="93" text="until when he reached a place between the two mountains, he found beside the mountains a people who scarcely understood anything."/>

		<aya index="96" text="Bring me ingots of iron.&quot; Then after he had filled up the space between the two mountain-sides, he said: &quot;(Light a fire) and ply bellows.&quot; When he had made it (red like) fire, he said: &quot;Bring me molten copper which I may pour on it.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="87" text="They answered: &quot;We did not break our promise with you out of our own volition; but we were laden with the load of people's ornaments, and we simply threw them down(into the fire), and the Samiri also threw down something,"/>

		<aya index="2" text="Whenever any fresh admonition comes to them from their Lord they barely heed it and remain immersed in play,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="their hearts being set on other concerns. The wrong-doers whisper to one another: &quot;This person is no more than a mortal like yourselves. Will you, then, be enchanted by sorcery while you see?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="He said: &quot;My Lord knows well all that is spoken in the heavens and the earth. He is All-Hearing, All- Knowing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="5" text="They say: &quot;Nay, these are confused dreams; nay, he has forged it; nay, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign, even as the Messengers of the past were sent with signs.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="6" text="Not one township that We destroyed before them believed. Would they, then, believe?"/>
		<aya index="7" text="(O Muhammad), even before you We never sent any other than human beings as Messengers, and to them We sent revelation. Ask the People of the Book if you do not know."/>
		<aya index="8" text="We did not endow the Messengers with bodies that would need no food; nor were they immortals."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Then We fulfilled the promise We had made to them: We rescued them and those whom We wished, and We destroyed those who exceeded all bounds."/>
		<aya index="10" text="We have bestowed upon you a Book that mentions you. Do you not understand?"/>
		<aya index="11" text="How many a wrong-doing town did We shatter and then raise up another people."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Then, when they perceived Our chastisement they took to their heels and fled."/>
		<aya index="13" text="(They were told): &quot;Flee not, but return to your comforts and to your dwellings. You are likely to be questioned.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="14" text="They said: &quot;Woe to us; surely we were wrong-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="They did not cease to cry this until We reduced them to stubble, still and silent."/>

		<aya index="18" text="Nay, We hurl the Truth at falsehood so that the Truth crushes falsehood, and lo! it vanishes. Woe to you for what you utter!"/>
		<aya index="19" text="To Him belongs whosoever dwells in the heavens and on earth. Those (angels) that are with Him neither disdain to serve Him out of pride, nor do they weary of it."/>
		<aya index="20" text="They glorify Him night and day, without flagging."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Have they taken earthly gods who are such that they raise up the dead to life?"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Had there been any gods in the heavens and the earth apart from Allah, the order of both the heavens and the earth would have gone to ruins. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Throne, Who is far above their false descriptions of Him."/>
		<aya index="23" text="None shall question Him about what He does, but they shall be questioned."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Have they taken gods other than Him? Say, (O Muhammad): &quot;Bring forth your proof! Here is the Book with admonition for those of my time and there are also scriptures with admonition for people before me.&quot; But most people do not know the Truth, and have, therefore, turned away from it."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Never did We send any Messenger before you to whom We did not reveal: &quot;There is no god but Me. So serve Me alone.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="They say: &quot;The Most Compassionate Lord has taken to Himself a son.&quot; Glory be to Him! Those whom they so designate are only His honoured servants."/>

		<aya index="29" text="And if anyone of them were to claim: &quot;Indeed I am a god apart from Him,&quot; We shall recompense both with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Did the unbelievers (who do not accept the teaching of the Prophet) not realize that the heavens and the earth were one solid mass, then We tore them apart, and We made every living being out of water? Will they, then, not believe (that We created all this)?"/>
		<aya index="31" text="And We placed firm mountains on earth lest it should sway with them, and We made wide paths in them that they may find their way;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="and We made the sky a secure canopy; and yet they turn away from these Signs."/>
		<aya index="33" text="It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Each of them is floating in its orbit."/>
		<aya index="34" text="(O Muhammad), We did not grant everlasting life to any human being even before you. If you were to die, will they live for ever?"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Every living being shall taste death and We shall subject you to ill and good by way of trial, and to Us shall all of you be eventually sent back."/>
		<aya index="36" text="When the unbelievers see you they make you an object of fun, saying: &quot;Is he the one who mentions your gods?&quot; They say so, and yet they reject with disdain the very mention of the Most Compassionate Lord."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Man is hasty by nature. I shall certainly show you My Signs. Do not ask Me to be hasty."/>
		<aya index="38" text="They say: &quot;(Tell us) when will the threat of punishment come to pass if you are truthful?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="If only the unbelievers knew of the Hour when they shall not be able to keep off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs; nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="40" text="That will suddenly come upon them and stupefy them. They shall not be able to ward it off, nor shall they be granted any respite."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Other Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who scoffed at the Messengers were overtaken by the same scourge that they had scoffed at."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Tell them, (O Muhammad): &quot;Who protects you, during the night or the day from the Most Compassionate Lord?&quot; And yet they turn away from the Admonition of their Lord."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Do they have any gods who would protect them against Us? They have no power even to help themselves; nor do they enjoy Our support."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Nay, We generously provided them and their fathers, and they enjoyed Our provision for long. Do they not see that We are now advancing into their territory, diminishing it from different sides? Is it they, then, who will triumph?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Tell them: &quot;I only warn you by the Revelation.&quot; But the deaf do not hear the cry when they are warned."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Were only the slightest whiff from your Lord's punishment to touch them, they would cry out: &quot;Woe to us; we were indeed wrong-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="We shall set up just scales on the Day of Resurrection so that none will be wronged in the least. (We shall bring forth the acts of everyone), even if it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed. We shall suffice as Reckoners."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Surely We had granted to Moses and Aaron the Criterion (between right and wrong), and Light and Admonition for the good of the God-fearing,"/>
		<aya index="49" text="for those who fear their Lord without seeing Him and dread the Hour (of Reckoning)."/>
		<aya index="50" text="This is a Blessed Admonition that We have revealed. Are you, then, going to reject it?"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Surely We had bestowed wisdom upon Abraham even earlier, and We knew him well."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Recall, when he said to his father and his people: &quot;What are these images to which you are devoutly clinging?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="They answered: &quot;We found our fathers worshipping them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="He said: &quot;Certainly you and your fathers have all been in manifest error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="55" text="They said: &quot;Are you expressing your true ideas before us or are you jesting?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="He said: &quot;Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth which He created and to that I bear witness before you."/>
		<aya index="57" text="By Allah, I shall certainly carry out my plan against your gods after you are gone.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="58" text="Then he broke them all into pieces, sparing only the supreme one among them that they may possibly return to him."/>
		<aya index="59" text="(When they saw the idols in this state) they said: &quot;Who has done this to our gods? Surely he is one of the wrong-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Some of them said: &quot;We heard a youth called Abraham speak (ill) of them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="The others said: &quot;Bring him, then, before the eyes of the people that they may see (what will be done to him).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="(On Abraham's arrival) they said: &quot;Abraham, are you he who has done this to our gods?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He answered: &quot;Rather it was this supreme one who has done it. So ask them, if they can speak.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Thereupon they turned to their (inner) selves and said (to themselves): &quot;Surely it is you who are the wrong-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="Then their minds were turned upside down, and they said: &quot;You know well that they do not speak.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Abraham said: &quot;Do you, then, worship beside Allah a thing that can neither benefit you nor hurt you?"/>
		<aya index="67" text="Fie upon you and upon all that you worship beside Allah. Do you have no sense?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said: &quot;Burn him, and come to the support of your gods, if you are going to do anything.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="We said: &quot;O fire, become coolness and safety for Abraham.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They had sought to do evil to him, but We caused them to be the worst losers,"/>
		<aya index="71" text="and We saved him and Lot and brought him to the land upon which We had bestowed Our blessings for all the people of the world."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob as an additional gift, making each of them righteous."/>
		<aya index="73" text="And We made them into leaders to guide people in accordance with Our command, and We inspired them to good works, and to establish Prayers and to give Zakah. They worshipped Us alone."/>
		<aya index="74" text="We bestowed upon Lot sound judgement and knowledge, and We delivered him from the city that was immersed in foul deeds. They were indeed a wicked people, exceedingly disobedient."/>
		<aya index="75" text="And We admitted him into Our mercy. Verily he was of the righteous."/>
		<aya index="76" text="We bestowed the same favour upon Noah. Recall, when he cried to Us before; We accepted his prayer and delivered him and his household from the great distress"/>
		<aya index="77" text="and We helped him against a people who rejected Our signs as false. They were indeed an evil people and so We drowned them all."/>
		<aya index="78" text="We bestowed the same favour upon David and Solomon. Recall, when they gave judgement regarding a tillage into which the sheep of some people had strayed at night, and We were witnesses to their judgement."/>
		<aya index="79" text="We guided Solomon to the right verdict, and We had granted each of them judgement and knowledge. We made the mountains and the birds celebrate the praise of Allah with David. It was We Who did all this."/>
		<aya index="80" text="It was We Who taught him the art of making coats of mail for your benefit so that it may protect you from each other's violence. Do you, then, give thanks?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="And We subdued the strongly raging wind to Solomon which blew at his bidding towards the land We blessed. We know everything."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And We subdued many devils who dived (into the sea) for him and carried out other jobs besides that. We kept watch over all of them."/>
		<aya index="83" text="We bestowed (the same wisdom, judgement and knowledge) upon Job. Recall, when he cried to his Lord: &quot;Behold, disease has struck me and You are the Most Merciful of those that are merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="We accepted his prayer and removed the affliction from him, and We not only restored to him his family but as many more with them as a mercy from Us and as a lesson to the worshippers."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And (We bestowed the same favour) upon Ishmael, Idris and Dhu al-Kifl, for they were all steadfast."/>
		<aya index="86" text="And We admitted them into Our mercy, for they were of the righteous."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And We bestowed Our favour upon Dhu al-Nun. Recall, when he went forth enraged, thinking We have no power to take him to task. Eventually he cried out in the darkness:&quot; There is no god but You. Glory be to You! I have done wrong.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="Thereupon We accepted his prayer, and rescued him from grief. Thus do We rescue the believers."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And We bestowed favour upon Zechariah, when he cried to his Lord: &quot;Lord! Leave me not solitary (without any issue). You are the Best Inheritor.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="So We accepted his prayer and bestowed upon him John, and We made his wife fit (to bear a child). Verily they hastened in doing good works and called upon Us with longing and fear, and humbled themselves to Us."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And also recall the woman who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our spirit, and made her and her son a Sign to the whole world."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Verily this community of yours is a single community, and I am your Lord; so worship Me."/>
		<aya index="93" text="But they tore asunder their faith into many parts. But to Us they are bound to return."/>
		<aya index="94" text="Then whosoever does righteous works, while believing, his striving will not go unappreciated. We record them all for him."/>
		<aya index="95" text="It has been ordained against every town that We ever destroyed that they shall not return (to enjoy a new lease of life)"/>
		<aya index="96" text="until Gog and Magog are let loose, and begin swooping from every mound,"/>
		<aya index="97" text="and the time for the fulfilment of the true promise of Allah draws near, whereupon the eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in fear, and they will say: &quot;Woe to us, we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we were wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="98" text="(They will be told): &quot;Verily you and the gods you worshipped beside Allah are the fuel of Hell. All of you are bound to arrive there."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Had these indeed been gods they would not have gone there. But (as it is), all of you shall ever abide in it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="100" text="There they shall groan with anguish and the din and noise in Hell will not let them hear anything."/>
		<aya index="101" text="But for those whom We had decided to favour with good reward, they shall be kept far removed from Hell."/>
		<aya index="102" text="They shall not hear even a whisper of it, and they shall live for ever in the delights which they had desired."/>
		<aya index="103" text="The Hour of the Great Terror shall not grieve them, and the angels shall receive them saying: &quot;This is your Day which you had been promised.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="104" text="On that Day We shall roll up the heavens like a scroll for writing. Even as We originated the creation first so We shall repeat it. This is a promise binding on Us; and so We shall do."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Surely We wrote in the Psalms, after the exhortation, that the earth shall be inherited by My righteous servants."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Herein, surely, is a message for those devoted to worship."/>
		<aya index="107" text="We have sent you forth as nothing but mercy to people of the whole world."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Say: &quot;It is revealed to me that your God is only One God. Will you, then, submit to Him?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="109" text="If they turn away, say to them: &quot;I have warned you all alike; and I cannot say whether what you have been promised is near or distant."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Indeed He knows what you say loudly and what you hide."/>
		<aya index="111" text="I think that this [reprieve] is possibly a trial for you, an opportunity to enjoy yourselves until an appointed time.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="The Messenger said: &quot;My Lord! Judge with truth. Our Compassionate Lord alone is our support against your (blasphemous) utterances.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="5" text="O mankind! If you have any doubt concerning Resurrection, then know that it is surely We Who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot of blood, then from a little lump of flesh, some of it shapely and other shapeless. (We are rehearsing this) that We may make the reality clear to you. We cause (the drop of sperm) that We please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time. We bring you forth as infants (and nurture you) that you may come of age. Among you is he that dies (at a young age) and he who is kept back to the most abject age so that after once having known, he reaches a stage when he knows nothing. You see the earth dry and barren and then no sooner than We send down water upon it, it begins to quiver and swell and brings forth every kind of beauteous vegetation."/>

Those who call upon aught other than Allah shall never be able to create even a fly, even if all of them were to come together to do that. And if the fly were to snatch away anything from them, they would not be able to recover that from it. Powerless is the supplicant; and powerless is he to whom he supplicates."/>

Keep to the faith of your father Abraham. Allah named you Muslims earlier and even in this (Book), that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over all mankind. So establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excellent Protector; what an excellent Helper!"/>

		<aya index="1" text="Ta'. Sin. Mim"/>
		<aya index="2" text="These are the verses of the Clear Book."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We recount to you with truth some parts of the story of Moses and Pharaoh for the benefit of those who believe."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Indeed Pharaoh transgressed in the land and divided its people into sections. One group of them he humiliated, and slew their sons and spared their daughters. Truly he was among the mischief-makers."/>
		<aya index="5" text="We wanted to bestow favour on those who were oppressed in the land. We wanted to make them leaders and heirs"/>
		<aya index="6" text="and to grant them power in the land, and make Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts see what they had feared."/>
		<aya index="7" text="We suggested to the mother of Moses: &quot;Suckle your child, but when you fear for his life cast him into the river and be not fearful nor grieve, for We shall restore him to you and make him one of the Messengers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then Pharaoh's household picked him up (from the river) that he may be their adversary and be a cause of sorrow to them. Surely Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts erred (in their scheming)."/>
		<aya index="9" text="The wife of Pharaoh said: &quot;Here is a delight of the eye to me and to you. Do not kill him. Maybe he will prove useful for us, or we may adopt him as a son.&quot; They were unaware of the end of it all."/>
		<aya index="10" text="On the other hand, the heart of Moses' mother was sorely distressed. Had We not strengthened her heart that she might have full faith (in Our promise), she would have disclosed the secret."/>
		<aya index="11" text="She told the sister of Moses: &quot;Follow him.&quot; So she kept watch over him unperceived (by the enemies)."/>
		<aya index="12" text="And We had already forbidden the breasts of the nurses for the child. (So seeing the girl) said: &quot;Shall I direct you to the people of a household that will rear him with utter sincerity?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Thus did We restore Moses to his mother that her eyes might be comforted and she might not grieve, and realise that the promise of Allah was true. But most people are unaware of this."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When Moses reached the age of full youth and grew to maturity, We bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward those who do good."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Once he entered the city at a time when its people were heedless, and he encountered two men fighting, one of whom belonged to his own people and the other to his foes. Now the man belonging to Moses' own people cried out to him for help against the man from the foes, and Moses struck him with his fist and finished him. Moses said: &quot;This is an act of Satan. Surely he is an enemy who openly misleads.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="Then he prayed: &quot;My Lord! I have indeed inflicted wrong on myself, so do forgive me,&quot; wherefore Allah forgave him for He is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Thereupon Moses vowed: &quot;My Lord, because of the favour that You have done me I shall never support the guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="The next morning he proceeded to the city in fear and looking around as one apprehensive of danger when all of a sudden, the man who had sought his help the day before again called out to him for his help. Moses said to him: &quot;Clearly, you are a very misguided fellow.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="And when Moses decided to lay his violent hands on the man belonging to the enemy, he cried out: &quot;Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday?&quot; You simply want to live in the land as a tyrant, and do not wish to set things right.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="20" text="Then a man came running from the farther end of the city and said: &quot;O Moses, the nobles are deliberating about you that they may put you to death. So do be gone. I am one of your well-wishers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="Soon after hearing this Moses departed in a state of fear, looking around as one in apprehension and prayed: &quot;My Lord, deliver me from these unjust people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="When (after his departure from Egypt) Moses headed towards Midian, he said: &quot;I hope my Lord will show me the right Path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="When he arrived at the spring of Midian, he found there a crowd of people watering their flocks, and he found apart from them two women holding their flocks back. He asked the women: &quot;What is it that troubles you?&quot; They said: &quot;We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take their flocks away, and our father is a very old man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="On hearing this Moses watered their flocks for them, and then returned in a shaded place and said: &quot;My Lord, I am truly in great need of any good that You might send down to me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Soon thereafter one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully, and said: &quot;My father invites you that he may reward you for your having watered our flocks for us. &quot; When Moses came to him and narrated to him the whole of his story, he said: &quot;Have no fear. You are now safe from the iniquitous people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="One of the two women said: &quot;Father, employ this man in your service. The best whom you might employ is he who is strong and trustworthy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Her father said to Moses: &quot;I want to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you serve me for eight years. But if you complete ten years, that will be of your own accord (but not an obligation). I do not intend to treat you harshly. If Allah wills, you will find me an upright man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="Moses replied: &quot;So that is agreed between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, I trust that I shall not be wronged. Allah is a witness over the covenant we are committing ourselves to.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of the Mount (Sinai). He said to his family: &quot;Wait here; I have observed a fire. Maybe I will bring to you some news or a brand of fire from there that you may warm yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="But when he came to the fire, a cry was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in the hallowed ground: &quot;O Moses, verily I am Allah, the Lord of all creatures of the Universe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="He received the command: &quot;Throw away your rod!&quot; But when he saw the rod writhing as though it were a serpent, he turned back in retreat, and did not even look behind. (He was told): &quot;O Moses, go ahead and have no fear. You are perfectly secure."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Put your hand into your bosom, and it will come out shining without any blemish; and draw your hand close to your body to still your fear. Those are the two clear Signs from your Lord for Pharaoh and his chiefs, for truly they are a disobedient people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Moses said: &quot;My Lord, I have killed one person from among them, and I fear that they will kill me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="My brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper to confirm my truthfulness for I fear that they will reject me as a liar.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="He said: &quot;We will certainly strengthen you through your brother and will invest both of you with such power that they shall not be able to hurt you. With the help of Our Signs the two of you and your followers will prevail.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="But when Moses came to them with Our Clear Signs, they said: &quot;This is nothing but a magic that has been contrived. We never heard anything like it from our ancestors of yore.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Moses replied: &quot;My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and also whose end will be the best in the Hereafter. As for the wrongdoers, they shall not prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="Pharaoh said: &quot;O nobles, I do not know that you have any god beside myself. Haman, bake bricks out of clay and build a lofty palace for me so that I may mount up and be able to observe the god of Moses, even though I believe that Moses is a liar.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="And he and his hosts waxed arrogant in the land without any right, believing that they will never have to return to Us!"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Eventually We seized him and his hosts and We flung them into the sea. So do see the end of the wrong-doers!"/>
		<aya index="41" text="And We made them leaders who invite people to the Fire. On the Day of Judgement they shall not find help from any quarter."/>
		<aya index="42" text="We have made a curse to pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Judgement they shall be among the despised."/>
		<aya index="43" text="After We had destroyed the earlier generations We bestowed the Book on Moses - a source of enlightenment for people and a guidance and mercy -- that they may take heed."/>
		<aya index="44" text="(O Muhammad), you were then not on the western side when We bestowed this commandment (of Law), and you were not among its witnesses."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Thereafter We raised up many a generation and a long time passed. You were then not even present among the people of Midian to rehearse Our verses to them. But it is We Who are sending news about that."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Nor were you on the side of the Mount (Sinai) when We called out to Moses (in the first instance). But it is out of Mercy from your Lord (that you are being informed of all this) so that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you. Maybe they will take heed."/>
		<aya index="47" text="(We did so) lest a calamity might seize them because of the misdeeds they committed whereafter they would say: &quot;Our Lord, why did you not send a Messenger to us that we follow Your revelation and become among those who believe?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But when the Truth reached them from Us, they said: &quot;Why was he not given that which was given to Moses?&quot; But did they not reject before what had been given to Moses? They said: &quot;Both are magic, each supporting the other!&quot; And they said: &quot;We deny each of these.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Tell them, (O Prophet): &quot;Then do bring a Book from Allah which is a better guide than either of them, and I will follow it! Do so if you are truthful!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="But if they do not hearken to this, know well that they only follow their lusts and who is in greater error than he who follows his lusts without any guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide those given to wrong-doing."/>
		<aya index="51" text="We have constantly conveyed them the word (of admonition) that they may take heed."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Those on whom We bestowed the Book before do believe in this (to wit, the Qur'an)."/>
		<aya index="53" text="When it is recited to them they say: &quot;We believe in it for it is the Truth from our Lord. Indeed we were already Muslims.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="These will be granted their reward twice over because they remained steadfast; they repel evil with good, and spend (in alms) out of the sustenance We provided them,"/>
		<aya index="55" text="and when they hear any vain talk, they turn away from it, saying: &quot;We have our deeds and you have your deeds. Peace be to you. We do not desire to act like the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="(O Prophet), you cannot grant guidance to whom you please. It is Allah Who guides those whom He will. He knows best who are amenable to guidance."/>
		<aya index="57" text="They say: &quot;If we were to follow this guidance with you, we should be snatched away from our land.&quot; Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And how many a town did We destroy whose inhabitants exulted on account of their affluence. These are their dwellings in which very few dwelt after them. Eventually it is We Who inherited them."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Your Lord would not destroy a town until He had sent to its centre a Messenger who would recite to them Our verses. Nor would We destroy any town unless its inhabitants were iniquitous."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Whatever you have been given is a provision for the life of this world and its glitter. But that which is with Allah is better and more enduring. Do you not use your intellect?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Now, he to whom We have promised a good which he is going to obtain - can he be like him whom We have given the good things of this life, but who will be brought up for punishment on the Day of Judgement?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="(Let them not forget) that the Day when Allah will call unto them, and say: &quot;Where are those whom you imagined to be My associates?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those against whom the Word will be realised will say: &quot;Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray just as we ourselves strayed. We absolve ourselves before You of all blame. It was not us that they worshipped.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="They will then be told: &quot;Call upon those for help whom you declared to be Our associates.&quot; They will then call upon them but they will not answer them. They will have observed the chastisement in front of them. Would that they were guided!"/>
		<aya index="65" text="(Let them not disregard) that the Day when Allah will call out to them saying: &quot;What was the answer you gave to the Messengers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Then they will not be able to think of any reply, nor will they be able to ask one another."/>
		<aya index="67" text="But those who repented and believed and acted righteously, they will perhaps be among those who will prosper there."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Your Lord creates what He will and chooses (for His tasks) whomsoever He will. It is not for them to make the choice. Glory be to Allah. He is exalted far above their associating others in His Divinity."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal."/>
		<aya index="70" text="He is Allah; there is no god but He. His is the praise in this world and in the Hereafter. His is the command and to Him will all of you be returned."/>
		<aya index="71" text="(O Prophet), tell them: &quot;Did you consider: if Allah were to make the night perpetual over you till the Day of Judgement, is there a god other than Allah who can bring forth light for you? Do you not hear?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say: &quot;Did you consider: if Allah were to make the day become perpetual over you till the Day of Judgement, is there a god other than Allah who can bring in night for you that you may repose in it? Will you not see?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you night and day that you may repose (during the night) and seek His Bounty (during the day) that you might be grateful."/>
		<aya index="74" text="(Let them bear in mind) that on that Day when He will call out to them saying: &quot;Where are My associates, those whom you imagined to be so?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="And from each people We shall draw a witness, and shall say to them: &quot;Do produce your evidence now.&quot; Then they shall know that the Truth is with Allah alone, and the lies which they had invented will forsake them."/>
		<aya index="76" text="To be sure, Qarun (Korah) was one of Moses' people; then he transgressed against them. We had bestowed on him such treasure that their very keys would have been raised with difficulty by a whole group of strong people. Once when his people said to him: &quot;Do not exult, for Allah does not love those who exult (in their riches)."/>
		<aya index="77" text="Seek by means of the wealth that Allah has granted you the Abode of the Hereafter, but forget not your share in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you and do not strive to create mischief in the land, for Allah loves not those who create mischief.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="He replied: &quot;All this has been given to me on account of a certain knowledge that I have.&quot; Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him those who were stronger in might than he and were more numerous in multitude? The wicked are not asked about their acts of sin."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Once Korah went forth among his people in full glitter. Those seeking the life of this world said: &quot;Would that we had the like of what Korah has! He truly has a great fortune.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="But those endowed with true knowledge said: &quot;Woe to you. The reward of Allah is best for those who believe and act righteously. But none except those who are patient shall attain to this.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="At last We caused the earth to swallow him and his house. Thereafter there was no group of people that could come to his aid against Allah; nor was he able to come to his own aid."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: &quot;Alas, we had forgotten that it is Allah Who increases the provision of those of His servants whom He will and grants in sparing measure to those whom He will. But for Allah's favour upon us, He could have made us to be swallowed too. Alas, we had forgotten that the unbelievers do not prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="As for the Abode of the Hereafter, We shall assign it exclusively for those who do not seek glory on earth nor want to cause mischief. The God-fearing shall have the best end."/>
		<aya index="84" text="He who shall bring a good deed shall be rewarded with what is better. But those who bring evil deeds shall not be requited more than their deeds."/>
		<aya index="85" text="(O Prophet), surely He Who has ordained the Qur'an on you will bring you to the best end. Say to them: &quot;My Lord knows best who has brought true guidance and who is in clear error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="(O Prophet), you never looked forward for the Book to be revealed to you. It is out of sheer Mercy of your Lord that it was (revealed to you). So do not lend any support to the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And let it never happen that the unbelievers might turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been revealed to you. Call people to your Lord and never become one of the unbelievers,"/>
		<aya index="88" text="and do not invoke any god beside Allah. There is no god but He. All will perish but He. To Him belongs the command. And to Him shall all of you return."/>

		<aya index="24" text="David said: “He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his ewes; and indeed many who live together commit excesses, one to the other, except those that believe and act righteously; and they are but few.” (While so saying) David realized that it is We Who have put him to test; therefore, he sought the forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down, bowing and penitently turning (to Him)."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Thereupon We forgave him his shortcoming and indeed (an exalted position of) nearness awaits him, and an excellent resort."/>
		<aya index="26" text="(We said to him): “O David, We have appointed you vicegerent on earth. Therefore, rule among people with justice and do not follow (your) desire lest it should lead you astray from Allah's Path.

		<aya index="42" text="(We commanded him): “Stamp your foot on earth, and here is cool water to wash with and to drink.”"/>
		<aya index="43" text="And We granted to him his family and also the like of them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to people of understanding,"/>
		<aya index="44" text="(and We said to him): “Take in your hand a bundle of rushes and strike with it, and do not break your oath.” Indeed We found him steadfast. How excellent a servant (of Ours) he was. Indeed he constantly turned (to his Lord)."/>

		<aya index="1" text="The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Most Mighty, the Most Wise."/>
		<aya index="2" text="(O Prophet), it is We Who have revealed this Book to you with Truth. So serve only Allah, consecrating your devotion to Him."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Lo, religion is exclusively devoted to Allah. Your religion is entirely consecrated to Him. As for those who have taken others than Allah for their guardians, (they say): “We worship them only that they may bring us nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between them concerning what they differ about. Verily Allah does not guide anyone who is given to sheer lying, is an utter unbeliever."/>
		<aya index="4" text="If Allah had wanted to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen anyone He wanted out of those whom He creates. Glory be to Him (that He should have a son). He is Allah: the One, the Overpowering."/>
		<aya index="5" text="He created the heavens and the earth with Truth, and He folds up the day over the night and folds up the night over the day. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each is running its course until an appointed time. Lo, He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving."/>
		<aya index="6" text="He it is Who created you from a single being, and He it is Who made from it its mate. He it is Who created for you eight heads of cattle in pairs. He creates you in your mothers' wombs, giving you one form after another in threefold depths of darkness. That, then, is Allah, your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is no god but He. So, whence are you being turned astray?"/>
		<aya index="7" text="If you disbelieve, know well that Allah has no need of you. Yet He does not like unbelief in His servants. But if you are thankful, your thankfulness will please Him. No one shall bear another's burden. You are destined to return to your Lord and He will tell you what you used to do. He is well aware even of what lies hidden in your breasts."/>
		<aya index="8" text="When any affliction befalls man, he cries out to his Lord, penitently turning to Him. But when his Lord bestows His favour upon him, he forgets the affliction regarding which he had cried out and sets up compeers to Allah that they may lead others astray from His Path. Say, (O Prophet): “Enjoy your unbelief for a while. Surely you will be among the inmates of the Fire.”"/>
		<aya index="9" text="Is such a person (preferable or he) who is obedient, and prostrates himself in the watches of the night, stands (in Prayer), is fearful of the Hereafter, and looks forward to the mercy of His Lord? Ask them: “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” Only those endowed with understanding take heed."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Tell them (O Prophet): “O you servants of Mine who believe, have fear of your Lord. A good end awaits those who did good in this world. Allah's earth is spacious. Verily those who persevere shall be granted their reward beyond all reckoning.”"/>
		<aya index="11" text="Tell them, (O Prophet): “I am bidden to serve Allah, consecrating my devotion to Him,"/>
		<aya index="12" text="and I am bidden to be the first of those who surrender to Him.”"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Say: “If I disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of an Awesome Day.”"/>

		<aya index="15" text="So serve, apart from Him, whomsoever you please.” Say: “Behold, the real losers shall be those who will have lost their own selves and their kith and kin on the Day of Resurrection. Behold, that is the obvious loss."/>
		<aya index="16" text="There shall be sheets of fire above them and beneath them. This is the end against which Allah warns His servants. So dread My wrath, O you servants of Mine!”"/>
		<aya index="17" text="(On the other hand), good tidings await those who eschew serving false gods and penitently return to Allah. (O Prophet), give good tidings to My servants,"/>
		<aya index="18" text="to those who pay heed to what is said and follow the best of it. They are the ones whom Allah has guided to the Right Way; they are the ones endowed with understanding."/>
		<aya index="19" text="(O Prophet), can you save him (from chastisement) against whom the sentence of chastisement has become due; him who has, (as it were), already fallen into the Fire?”"/>
		<aya index="20" text="But those who fear their Lord shall have lofty mansions built over one another beneath which rivers flow. This is Allah's promise and never does Allah fail to fulfil His promise."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Do you not see that Allah sent down water from the sky, then made it flow on earth as springs and streams and rivers and then with it He brings forth vegetation of various hues; then this vegetation ripens and dries up, turning yellow, whereafter He reduces it to broken straw? Surely there is a lesson in this for those endowed with understanding."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Can he whose breast Allah has opened up for Islam and who is thus (moving along a Path) illumined by a light from Allah (be likened to him who derives no lesson from what he observes)? Woe, then, to those whose hearts were further hardened after Allah's admonition. Such are indeed in obvious error."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Allah has revealed the best teaching, a self-consistent Book which repeats its contents in manifold forms whereat shiver the skins of those that hold their Lord in awe, and then their skins and their hearts soften for Allah's remembrance. That is Allah's Guidance wherewith He guides whosoever He pleases. And he whom Allah does not guide to the Right Path has none to guide him."/>
		<aya index="24" text="How woeful is the plight of him who has nothing except his face to shield him from severe chastisement on the Day of Resurrection? Such evil-doers shall be told: “Taste now the consequence of your deeds.”"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Their predecessors gave the lie to the Truth and then chastisement came upon them from whence they could not imagine."/>
		<aya index="26" text="So Allah made them taste degradation in the life of this world, and certainly the chastisement of the Hereafter will be much more grievous. Would that they knew!"/>
		<aya index="27" text="We have indeed propounded for mankind all kinds of parables in this Qur'an that they may take heed."/>
		<aya index="28" text="It is an Arabic Qur'an free of all crookedness that they may guard against their evil end."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Allah propounds a parable: there is a man whose ownership is shared by several quarrelsome masters, each pulling him to himself; and there is another who is exclusively owned by one man. Can the two be alike? All praise and thanks be to Allah. But most of them are unaware."/>
		<aya index="30" text="(O Prophet), you are destined to die and they too are destined to die."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Then eventually all of you will contend before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Who, then, can be more unjust than he who lied against Allah and denied the Truth when it came to him, calling it a lie? Is there no room for such unbelievers in Hell?"/>
		<aya index="33" text="But he who brought the Truth, and those who confirmed it as true, such are the ones who shall be guarded against the chastisement."/>
		<aya index="34" text="They shall have from their Lord all that they wish for. That is the reward of those that do good,"/>
		<aya index="35" text="so that Allah may remit their worst deeds and reward them according to the best of their deeds."/>
		<aya index="36" text="(O Prophet), does Allah not suffice for His servant? They frighten you with others apart from Him, although he whom Allah lets go astray, none can guide him to the Right Way."/>
		<aya index="37" text="And he whom Allah guides to the Right Way, none can lead him astray. Is not Allah the Most Mighty, the Lord of Retribution?"/>
		<aya index="38" text="If you ask them: “Who created the heavens and the earth?” they will surely answer: “Allah.” Tell them: “What do you think, then, of the deities whom you call upon instead of Allah? If Allah should will that an affliction befall me, will those deities remove the harm inflicted by Him? Or if Allah should will that I receive (His) Mercy, will they be able to withhold His Mercy from me?” Say: “Allah is sufficient for me; those who have to put their trust, let them put their trust in Him."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Tell them: “My people, continue to work in your position as you will, I too will continue with my work. Soon you shall know"/>
		<aya index="40" text="whom the degrading chastisement will visit and upon whom the everlasting chastisement will alight."/>
		<aya index="41" text="(O Prophet), We revealed to you the Book with the Truth for all mankind. So he who follows the Right Way does so to his own benefit, and he who goes astray, shall hurt only himself by straying. You are not accountable on their behalf."/>
		<aya index="42" text="It is Allah Who takes away the souls of people at the hour of their death, and takes away at the time of sleep the souls of those that have not died. Then He retains the souls of those against whom He had decreed death and returns the souls of others till an appointed time. Surely there are Signs in this for a people who reflect."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Or have they taken others instead of Allah as intercessors? Say: “Will they intercede though they may have no power and though they may not even understand?”"/>
		<aya index="44" text="Say: “All intercession lies with Allah. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And to Him will all of you be sent back.”"/>
		<aya index="45" text="When Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter contract with bitterness, but when deities apart from Allah are mentioned, they are filled with joy."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Say: “O Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Knower of the unseen and the seen, You it is Who will judge among Your servants concerning what they differed."/>
		<aya index="47" text="If the wrong-doers possessed the treasures of the earth in their entirety and as much besides, they would gladly offer it on the Day of Resurrection to redeem themselves from the harrowing chastisement. This because there will appear to them from Allah something (exceedingly dismal which) they had never even imagined."/>
		<aya index="48" text="The evil consequences of their deeds will become fully apparent to them, and what they had scoffed at will encompass them."/>
		<aya index="49" text="When an affliction befalls man, he cries out to Us; but when We grant him a favour from Us, he says: “I have been granted this on account of my knowledge.” Nay; this (favour) is a test; but most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Their predecessors also said the same, but their earnings proved of no avail to them,"/>
		<aya index="51" text="and the evil consequences of their deeds overtook them. The wrongdoers among these will also be overtaken by the evil consequences of their deeds. They will be utterly unable to frustrate (Us)."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Do they not know that Allah enlarges and straitens the provision of whomsoever He pleases? Therein are Signs for those that believe."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Tell them, (O Prophet): “My servants who have committed excesses against themselves, do not despair of Allah's Mercy. Surely Allah forgives all sins. He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Turn to your Lord and surrender yourselves to Him before the chastisement over-takes you; for then you will receive no help."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord before the chastisement suddenly comes upon you without you even being aware of it.”"/>
		<aya index="56" text="Lest a person should say: “Alas for me for neglecting my duty towards Allah and for being among those that scoffed”;"/>
		<aya index="57" text="and lest a person should say: “If only Allah had guided me, I should have been one of the God-fearing”;"/>
		<aya index="58" text="or lest he should say, when he sees the chastisement: “O that I might return again, and be among those who do good.”"/>
		<aya index="59" text="Yes indeed! But My Signs came to you and you rejected them as lies, and waxed arrogant and were among those who disbelieved."/>
		<aya index="60" text="On the Day of Resurrection you shall see that the faces of those who had lied against Allah have turned dark. Is Hell not vast enough to provide a room to the vainglorious?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="But as for the God-fearing, Allah will deliver them on account of their achievements: no harm shall visit them nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Allah is the Creator of everything; He is the Guardian over everything."/>
		<aya index="63" text="To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. It is those who disbelieve in Allah's Signs who will be the losers."/>

		<aya index="65" text="(Tell them clearly that) it was revealed to you and to all Prophets before you: “If you associate any others with Allah in His Divinity, your works will surely come to naught and you will certainly be among the losers.”"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Therefore, serve Allah alone and be among those who give thanks."/>
		<aya index="67" text="They did not recognise the true worth of Allah. (Such is Allah's power that) on the Day of Resurrection the whole earth will be in His grasp, and the heavens shall be folded up in His Right Hand. Glory be to Him! Exalted be He from all that they associate with Him."/>
		<aya index="68" text="And the Trumpet shall be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth shall fall down dead save those whom Allah wills. Then the Trumpet shall be blown again, and lo! all of them will be standing and looking on."/>

		<aya index="17" text="(It will then be said): “Today shall everyone be fully recompensed for his deeds. None shall be wronged today. Surely Allah is Swift in Reckoning.”"/>
		<aya index="18" text="(O Prophet), then warn them of the Day that has drawn near, the Day when hearts full of suppressed grief will leap up to the throats and the wrong-doers shall neither have any sincere friend nor intercessor whose word will be heeded."/>
		<aya index="19" text="He knows even the most stealthy glance of the eyes and all the secrets that hearts conceal."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Allah will judge with justice, whereas those whom they call upon beside Him cannot judge at all. Surely Allah -- and He alone -- is All- Hearing, All-Seeing."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Have they not journeyed in the land that they might observe the end of those who came before them? They were even greater in strength than they and left behind more splendid traces in the land. Then Allah seized them because of their sins and they had none who could protect them from Allah."/>
		<aya index="22" text="They came to this end because their Messengers would come to them with Clear Signs and yet they would refuse to believe. So Allah seized them. He is indeed Strong, Terrible in Retribution."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Verily We sent Moses with Our Signs and a clear authority"/>
		<aya index="24" text="to Pharaoh and Haman and Korah. They said: “(He is) a sorcerer, an utter liar.”"/>
		<aya index="25" text="When Moses brought them the Truth from Us they said: “Kill the sons of all the believers who have joined him, but spare the women.” The guile of the unbelievers always ends in vain."/>
		<aya index="26" text="One day Pharaoh said: “Let me go and kill Moses; then let him invoke his Lord. I fear that he will change your religion or cause disruption in the land.”"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Moses said: “I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord from everyone who waxes arrogant and does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.”"/>
		<aya index="28" text="Then a man endowed with faith, from Pharaoh's folk, who had kept his faith hidden, said: “Do you kill a person simply because he says: 'My Lord is Allah' even though he brought to you clear Signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will recoil upon him; but if he is truthful, you will be smitten with some of the awesome consequences of which he warns you. Allah does not guide to the Right Way any who exceeds the limits and is an utter liar."/>
		<aya index="29" text="My people, today the kingdom is yours, and you are supreme in the land. But if Allah's chastisement were to come upon you, who will come to our help?” Pharaoh said: “I only counsel what I consider right; I only direct you to the Path of Rectitude.”"/>
		<aya index="30" text="He who had faith said: “My people, I fear that you will confront a day like that which overtook many parties before you,"/>
		<aya index="31" text="like the day that overtook the people of Noah and Ad and Thamud, and those who came after them. Allah does not wish to subject His servants to any injustice."/>
		<aya index="32" text="My people, I fear that you will encounter a day when there will be much wailing and you will cry out to one another for help,"/>
		<aya index="33" text="the day when you will turn around to retreat, there will be none to protect you from Allah. He whom Allah lets go astray, none will be able to show him the Right Way."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Verily Joseph came to you with Clear Signs before, yet you continued to doubt his Message. Thereafter when he died, you said: 'Allah shall send no Messenger after him.'” Thus Allah leads astray those who transgress the limits and are given to much doubting;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="those who contend regarding Allah's Signs without any evidence that might have come to them. That is exceedingly loathsome to Allah and to those that believe. Thus does Allah seal the heart of everyone who is proud and high-handed."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Pharaoh said: “Haman, build for me a lofty tower that I may scale the highways --"/>
		<aya index="37" text="the highways to the heavens -- and have a look at the God of Moses, although I am certain that Moses is a liar.” Thus Pharaoh's evil deed was made to seem fair to him, and he was barred from the Right Path. Pharaoh's guile only led him to his own perdition."/>
		<aya index="38" text="The person endowed with faith said: “My people, follow me; I shall direct you to the Path of Rectitude."/>
		<aya index="39" text="My people, the life of this world is ephemeral, whereas the Hereafter, that is the permanent abode."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Whosoever does an evil deed will be requited only with the like of it; and whosoever acts righteously and has attained to faith -- be he a male or a female -- they shall enter Paradise and be provided sustenance beyond all reckoning."/>
		<aya index="41" text="My people, how is it that I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="you call me to deny Allah and to associate with Him as His partners those regarding whom I have no knowledge (that they are Allah's partners in His Divinity), whereas I call you to the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving?"/>
		<aya index="43" text="There is no doubt that those whom you call me to have no claim to be called upon in this world and in the Hereafter. Certainly to Allah shall be our return, and those who exceed the limits are destined to the Fire."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Soon you shall remember what I say to you. I entrust my affairs to Allah. Surely Allah is watchful over His servants.”"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Eventually Allah saved the person endowed with faith from all the evils of their guile, and a woeful chastisement encompassed the Pharaonites."/>
		<aya index="46" text="They are exposed to the Fire every morning and evening; and when the Last Hour will come to pass, a command shall be given: “Admit the Pharaonites to an even more severe chastisement.”"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Just imagine when they will remonstrate with one another in Hell. The weak ones will say to those who waxed proud: “We were your followers. Will you, then, lighten for us a part of our suffering of the Fire?”"/>
		<aya index="48" text="Those who had waxed proud will reply: “All of us are in it. Allah has already passed His judgement among His servants.”"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Those suffering in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell: “Call upon your Lord to lighten the chastisement for us just for a day.”"/>
		<aya index="50" text="The keepers of Hell will ask: “Did your Messengers not come to you with Clear Signs?” They will say: “Yes (they did).” The keepers of Hell will say: “Then you yourselves should call (upon the Lord). And the call of the unbelievers will end in vain.”"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Surely We shall help Our Messengers and the believers in the life of this world and on the Day when witnesses will rise to testify,"/>
		<aya index="52" text="the Day when the excuses offered by the wrong-doers shall not avail them. They shall be victims of the curse and a woeful abode."/>
		<aya index="53" text="We surely guided Moses and made the Children of Israel the heirs of the Book"/>

		<aya index="55" text="Be steadfast, then, (O Prophet), Allah's promise is true. Seek forgiveness for your shortcomings, and celebrate the praise of your Lord, evening and morning."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Verily those who dispute regarding the Signs of Allah without any evidence that might have come to them, nothing but vain pride fills their hearts. Yet they shall never be able to satisfy the pride with which they are puffed up. So seek refuge with Allah. Verily He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Surely the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater act than the creation of human beings. But most people do not know."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Never can the blind and the seeing be equal; nor those that believe and act righteously and those that do evil. Little do you understand."/>
		<aya index="59" text="The Hour will indeed come; there is no doubt about that. Yet most people do not believe."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Your Lord said: “Pray to Me, and I will accept your prayers. Surely those who wax too proud to worship Me shall enter Hell, utterly abased.”"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Allah it is Who made the night so that you may seek repose in it, and made the day radiant. Surely Allah is Most Bounteous to people; but most people do not give thanks."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Allah (Who bestowed all these favours upon you) is your Lord, the Creator of everything. There is no god but He. Whence are you, then, being led astray?"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Thus it is only those who had denied Allah's Signs that were led astray."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Allah it is Who made the earth a dwelling place for you and made the sky a canopy, Who shaped you -- and shaped you exceedingly well -- and gave you good things as sustenance. That is Allah, your Lord; blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Universe."/>
		<aya index="65" text="He is the Ever-Living: there is no god but He. So call upon Him, consecrating to Him all your devotion. All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Say, (O Prophet): “I have been forbidden to worship those beside Allah whom you call upon. (How can I worship any beside Allah) when clear Signs have come to me from my Lord and I have been commanded to surrender to Allah, the Lord of the Universe?”"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He it is Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clot; then He brings you out as an infant, then causes you to grow into full maturity, and then causes you to grow further so that you may reach old age, while some of you He recalls earlier. All this is in order that you may reach an appointed term and that you may understand (the Truth)."/>
		<aya index="68" text="He it is Who gives life and causes death. Whenever He decrees a thing, He only commands to it “Be”, and it is."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Did you not see those who dispute concerning Allah's Signs? Whence are they, then, being turned astray?"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Those who gave the lie to this Book and all the Books which We had sent with Our Messengers shall soon come to know the Truth"/>

		<aya index="73" text="It will then be said to them: “Where are those whom you"/>
		<aya index="74" text="associated with Allah in His Divinity?” They will say: “We have lost them; rather, we never used to call upon anyone before.” Thus will Allah cause them to stumble in error."/>
		<aya index="75" text="(They will be told): “This is because while you were on earth you took delight in untruth and exulted in it."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Enter Hell now to abide in it. How woeful is the abode of those who wax proud!"/>
		<aya index="77" text="So be patient, (O Prophet). Surely Allah's promise is true. Whether We show them a part of the woeful consequences against which We warn them (while you are still in their midst) or We recall you (from this world) before that, eventually it is to Us that they shall be brought back."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Indeed We sent many Messengers before you: of them there are some whose account We have narrated to you and there are others whose account We have not narrated to you. It did not lie in any Messenger's power to bring any Sign except with Allah's leave.

		<aya index="84" text="When they saw Our chastisement, they said: “We have come to believe in Allah, the Only One, and we reject all what we had associated (with Allah in His Divinity).”"/>
		<aya index="85" text="But their believing after they had seen Our chastisement did not avail them. That has been Allah's Way concerning His servants. And the unbelievers courted utter loss, then and there."/>

		<aya index="34" text="He may, while forgiving much of the sins of those that ride these ships, drown them on account of some of their misdeeds."/>

		<aya index="51" text="It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him except through revelation, or from behind a veil, or that a messenger (an angel) be sent to him who reveals to him by Allah's leave whatever He wishes. He is All-High, Most Wise."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Even so We revealed to you, (O Prophet), a spirit by Our command. (Ere to that) you knew neither what the Book nor what the faith was.

		<aya index="8" text="We utterly destroyed them although they were greater in might than these. The examples of ancient peoples have gone before."/>

		<aya index="14" text="It is to our Lord that we shall eventually return.”"/>
		<aya index="15" text="Yet they have made some of His servants a part of Him. Indeed man is most evidently thankless."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Has Allah taken for Himself daughters out of those whom He creates and has chosen you to have sons?"/>
		<aya index="17" text="(They believe so although when) any of them is given tidings of the birth of a female child the like of which he assigns to the Merciful One, his countenance darkens and he is choked with grief."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Do they assign to Allah one who grows up amidst ornaments and is not well-versed in the art of disputation?"/>
		<aya index="19" text="They claim that angels, who are Allah's chosen servants, are females. Did they witness how their body is constituted? Their testimony shall be written and they shall be called to account."/>
		<aya index="20" text="They say: “Had the Merciful One so willed, we would never have worshipped these deities.” But they have no knowledge of the matter and are simply conjecturing."/>

		<aya index="22" text="Nay; they simply claim: “We found our forefathers on a way, and we continue to find guidance in their footsteps.”"/>
		<aya index="23" text="And thus it is: whenever We sent any warner to a city its affluent ones said: “We found our forefathers on a way and we continue to follow in their footsteps.”"/>
		<aya index="24" text="Each Prophet asked them: “Will you do so even if we were to show you a way better than the way of your forefathers?” They answered: “We disbelieve in the religion with which you have been sent.”"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then We exacted retribution from them. So do consider the end of those who gave the lie (to the Prophets)."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Call to mind when Abraham said to his father and his people: “I totally disown all whom you serve"/>
		<aya index="27" text="except the One Who created me; and, behold, it is He Who will direct me to the Right Way.”"/>
		<aya index="28" text="And Abraham left behind this word to endure among his posterity so that they may return to it."/>
		<aya index="29" text="(Even when they began worshipping others than Allah We did not destroy them) but bestowed sustenance on them and on their forefathers until there came to them the Truth and a Messenger who clearly expounded things to them."/>

		<aya index="32" text="Is it they who distribute the Mercy of your Lord? It is We Who have distributed their livelihood among them in the life of this world, and have raised some above others in rank that some of them may harness others to their service. Your Lord's Mercy is better than all the treasures that they hoard."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Were it not that all mankind would become a single community (and follow the same way), We would have provided for all those who disbelieve in the Merciful One silver roofs for their houses, and (silver) stairs on which to go up,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="and (silver) doors to their houses, and couches (of silver) upon which they would recline;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="or that they be made of gold. Surely all this is only the enjoyment of the life of the world. But (true prosperity) in the Hereafter with Your Lord is only for the God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="36" text="He who is negligent to remember the Merciful One, to him We assign a satan as his boon companion,"/>
		<aya index="37" text="and these satans hinder them from the Right Path, while he still reckons himself to be rightly-guided."/>
		<aya index="38" text="But when he comes to Us, he will say (to his satan): “Would that there had been between me and you the distance as between the East and the West. How evil a companion you were!”"/>
		<aya index="39" text="(He will then be told): “Today it will not benefit you the least that after your wrong-doing you and your satans now share the chastisement.”"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Can you, (O Prophet), then make the deaf hear, or direct to the Right Way the blind or one lost in manifest error?"/>
		<aya index="41" text="We shall inflict retribution on them, whether We take you away from the world (before We do that),"/>
		<aya index="42" text="or make you see the end that We had promised them, for We have full power over them."/>
		<aya index="43" text="So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. Surely you are on the Straight Way."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Verily it is a great source of eminence for you and your people, and soon you will be called to account concerning that."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Ask all Our Messengers whom We sent before you whether We had appointed any deities beside the Merciful One to be worshipped."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Indeed We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his nobles. He told them: “I am a Messenger of the Lord of the Universe.”"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Yet when he brought forth Clear Signs from Us, then lo, they burst into laughter."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Every Sign that We showed them was greater than its predecessor; and then We seized them with Our chastisement so that they may return (to the Right Way)."/>
		<aya index="49" text="(Whenever they faced an affliction) they would say: “O magician, pray for us to your Lord according to your station with Him. We shall certainly be guided to the Right Way.”"/>
		<aya index="50" text="But lo, each time We removed Our affliction from them, they would go back on their word."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people: “My people, do I not have dominion over Egypt, and are these streams not flowing beneath me? Can't you see?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Am I better or this contemptible man who is scarcely able to express himself?"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Why were bracelets of gold not bestowed upon him? Why did a retinue of angels not accompany him as attendants?”"/>
		<aya index="54" text="He incited his people to levity and they obeyed him. Surely they were an iniquitous people."/>
		<aya index="55" text="So when they incurred Our wrath, We exacted retribution from them, and drowned them all,"/>
		<aya index="56" text="and made them a thing of the past and an example for those who would come after them."/>
		<aya index="57" text="No sooner the example of the son of Mary was mentioned than, lo and behold, your people raised a clamour"/>
		<aya index="58" text="and said: “Who is better, our deities or he?” They said so only out of contentiousness. They are a disputatious people."/>
		<aya index="59" text="He was no more than a servant (of Ours), one upon whom We bestowed Our favours and whom We made an example (of Our infinite power) for the Children of Israel."/>
		<aya index="60" text="If We had so willed We could have made some of you into angels to become your successors on earth."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Verily he [i.e., Jesus) is a portent of the Hour. So be in no doubt concerning it and follow Me. This is the Straight Way."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Let not Satan hinder you (from believing in the Hour), for surely he is your open enemy."/>
		<aya index="63" text="When Jesus came with Clear Signs and said: “I have brought wisdom to you that I may make plain to you some of the things you differ about. So fear Allah and follow me."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Allah is my Lord and your Lord; therefore, serve Him. That is the Straight Way.”"/>
		<aya index="65" text="Then the factions fell apart among themselves. So woe to the wrong-doers from the chastisement of a grievous Day."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Are they awaiting anything other than the Last Hour that it should suddenly come upon them without their even perceiving it?"/>
		<aya index="67" text="On that Day even bosom friends shall become enemies to one another, all except the God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="68" text="(It will be said to them): “My servants, today you have nothing to fear or regret,"/>

		<aya index="73" text="Herein you will have abundant fruits of which you will eat.”"/>

		<aya index="75" text="Never will their torment be lightened for them. They shall remain in utter despair."/>
		<aya index="76" text="It is not We Who wronged them; rather, it is they who wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They shall call out: “O Malik, let your Lord put an end to us.” He will reply: “You must stay on in it."/>
		<aya index="78" text="We brought you the Truth; but to the truth most of you were averse.”"/>
		<aya index="79" text="Have they contrived some scheme? If so, We too will contrive a scheme."/>
		<aya index="80" text="Or do they think that We do not hear their secret talks and their whispering counsels? Yes, indeed We do and Our messengers [i.e., angels) are with them, writing."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Say: “If the Merciful One had a son, I would have been the first one to worship him.”"/>

		<aya index="87" text="If you were to ask them: “Who created them?” they will surely say: “Allah.” Whence are they, then, being led astray?"/>
		<aya index="88" text="We call to witness the cry of the Messenger: “O Lord, these are a people not wont to believe!”"/>

Those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting before the Victory cannot be equated (with those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting afterwards). They are higher in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to each Allah has promised a good reward. Allah is well aware of all that you do."/>

Surely Allah is Most Strong, Most Mighty."/>

They themselves invented it in pursuit of Allah's good pleasure, and then they did not observe it as it ought to have been observed. So We gave their reward to those of them that believed. But many of them are wicked."/>
