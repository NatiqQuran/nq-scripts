	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="ALIF LAM MIM."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This is The Book free of doubt and involution, a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="Who believe in the Unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend in charity of what We have given them;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="5" text="They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for those who deny, it is all the same if you warn them or not, they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="God has sealed their hearts and ears, and veiled their eyes. For them is great deprivation."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And there are some who, though they say: &quot;We believe in God and the Last Day,&quot; (in reality) do not believe."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They (try to) deceive God and those who believe, yet deceive none but themselves although they do not know."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Sick are their hearts, and God adds to their malady. For them is suffering for they lie."/>
		<aya index="11" text="When asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say: &quot;Why, we are reformers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Yet they are surely mischief-mongers, even though they do not know."/>
		<aya index="13" text="When asked to believe as others do, they say: &quot;Should we believe like fools?&quot; And yet they are the fools, even though they do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet the faithful they say: &quot;We believe;&quot; but when alone with the devils (their fellows), they say: &quot;We are really with you; we were joking.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness."/>
		<aya index="16" text="They are indeed those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from the deal, nor found the right way."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They are like a man who kindles a fire, and when its glow has illumined the air God takes away their light leaving them in the dark where they will not be able to see."/>
		<aya index="18" text="They are deaf, dumb and blind, and shall never return;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers into their ears for safety against noise and death. But God surrounds those who believe not from all sides."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes. When it flashes forth they walk in its flare. When darkness returns they stand still. And if the Lord wills so He could take away their hearing and sight; surely God is all-powerful."/>
		<aya index="21" text="So, O you people, adore your Lord who created you, as He did those before you, that you could take heed for yourselves and fear Him"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow -- your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly."/>
		<aya index="23" text="If you are in doubt of what We have revealed to Our votary, then bring a Surah like this, and call any witness, apart from God, you like, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you cannot, as indeed you cannot, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, which has been prepared for the infidels."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Announce to those who believe and have done good deeds, glad tidings of gardens under which rivers flow, and where, when they eat the fruits that grow, they will say: &quot;Indeed they are the same as we were given before,&quot; so like in semblance the food would be. And they shall have fair spouses there, and live there abidingly."/>
		<aya index="26" text="God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true. But those who disbelieve say: &quot;What does God mean by this parable?&quot; He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Who, having sealed it, break God's covenant, dividing what He ordained cohered; and those who spread discord in the land will suffer assuredly."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Then how can you disbelieve in God? He gave you life when you were dead. He will make you die again then bring you back to life: To Him then you will return."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He made for you all that lies within the earth, then turning to the firmament He proportioned several skies: He has knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Remember, when your Lord said to the angels: &quot;I have to place a trustee on the earth,&quot; they said: &quot;Will You place one there who would create disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify Your name?&quot; And God said: &quot;I know what you do not know.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="Then He gave Adam knowledge of the nature and reality of all things and everything, and set them before the angels and said: &quot;Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="And they said: &quot;Glory to You (O Lord), knowledge we have none except what You have given us, for You are all-knowing and all-wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Then He said to Adam: &quot;Convey to them their names.&quot; And when he had told them, God said: &quot;Did I not tell you that I know the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose and know what you hide?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="Remember, when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who disdained and turned insolent, and so became a disbeliever."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said to Adam: &quot;Both you and your spouse live in the Garden, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors."/>
		<aya index="36" text="But Satan tempted them and had them banished from the (happy) state they were in. And We said: &quot;Go, one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then his Lord sent commands to Adam and turned towards him: Indeed He is compassionate and kind."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And We said to them: &quot;Go, all of you. When I send guidance, whoever follows it will neither have fear nor regret;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="But those who deny and reject Our signs will belong to Hell, and there abide unchanged.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you. So keep your pledge to Me, and I will mine to you, and be fearful of Me,"/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in what I have sent down which verifies what is already with you; and do not be the first to deny it, nor part with it for little gain; and beware of Me."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Do not confuse truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Be firm in devotion; give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others), and bow with those who bow (before God)."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Will you enjoin good deeds on the others and forget your own selves? You also read the Scriptures, why do you then not understand?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Find strength in fortitude and prayer, which is heavy and exacting but for those who are humble and meek,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Who are conscious that they have to meet their Lord, and to Him they have to return."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Remember, O children of Israel, the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Take heed of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least, when no intercession matter nor ransom avail, nor help reach them."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Remember, We saved you from the Pharaoh's people who wronged and oppressed you and slew your sons but spared your women: In this was a great favour from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Remember, We parted the sea and saved you, and drowned the men of Pharaoh before your very eyes."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Yet, remember, as We communed with Moses for forty nights you took the calf in his absence (and worshipped it), and you did wrong."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Even so, We pardoned you that you may be grateful."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Remember, We gave Moses the Book and Discernment of falsehood and truth, that you may be guided."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Remember, Moses said: &quot;My people, by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm, so now turn to your Creator in repentance, and kill your pride, which is better with your Lord.&quot; And (the Lord) softened towards you, for He is all-forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Remember, when you said to Moses: &quot;We shall not believe in you until we see God face to face,&quot; lightning struck you as you looked."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Even then We revived you after you had become senseless that you might give thanks;"/>
		<aya index="57" text="And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And remember, We said to you: &quot;Enter this city, eat wherever you like, as much as you please, but pass through the gates in humility and say: 'May our sins be forgiven.' We shall forgive your trespasses and give those who do good abundance."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But the wicked changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word distorted, and We sent from heaven retribution on the wicked, for they disobeyed."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And remember, when Moses asked for water for his people, We told him to strike the rock with his staff, and behold, twelve springs of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribes came to know its place of drinking. Eat and drink, (enjoy) God's gifts, and spread no discord in the land."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Remember, when you said: &quot;O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;&quot; he said: &quot;Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask.&quot; So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Surely the believers and the Jews, Nazareans and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and whosoever does right, shall have his reward with his Lord and will neither have fear nor regret."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: &quot;Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="But you went back (on your word), and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost."/>
		<aya index="65" text="You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to whom We had said: &quot;Become (like) apes despised,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Remember, when Moses said to his people: &quot;God demands that you sacrifice a cow,&quot; they said: &quot;Are you making fun of us?&quot; And he said: &quot;God forbid that I be of the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="&quot;Call on your Lord for us,&quot; they said, &quot;that He might inform us what kind she should be.&quot; &quot;Neither old nor young, says God, but of age in between,&quot; answered Moses. &quot;So do as you are bid.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="&quot;Call on your Lord,&quot; they said, &quot;to tell us the colour of the cow.&quot; &quot;God says,&quot; answered Moses, &quot;a fawn coloured cow, rich yellow, well pleasing to the eye.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="&quot;Call on your Lord,&quot; they said, &quot;to name its variety, as cows be all alike to us. If God wills we shall be guided aright.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="And Moses said: &quot;He says it's a cow unyoked, nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields, one in good shape with no mark or blemish.&quot; &quot;Now have you brought us the truth,&quot; they said; and then, after wavering, they sacrificed the cow."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed, God brought to light what you concealed."/>
		<aya index="73" text="We had pronounced already: &quot;Slay (the murderer) for (taking a life).&quot; Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Yet, in spite of this, your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder, but among rocks are those from which rivers flow; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth; as well as those that roll down for fear of God. And God is not negligent of all that you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="For when they meet the faithful, they say: &quot;We believe;&quot; but when among themselves, they say: &quot;Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you? They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord. Have you no sense indeed?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe, and are only lost in fantasies."/>
		<aya index="79" text="But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say: &quot;This is from God,&quot; so that they might earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it!"/>
		<aya index="80" text="Yet they say: &quot;The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days.&quot; Say.. &quot;Have you so received a promise from God?&quot; &quot;Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge. Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Why, they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error, are people of Hell, where they will abide for ever."/>
		<aya index="82" text="But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise, and shall live there forever."/>
		<aya index="83" text="Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: &quot;Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others),&quot; you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too."/>
		<aya index="85" text="But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Remember We gave Moses the Book and sent after him many an apostle; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear evidence of the truth, reinforcing him with divine grace. Even so, when a messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty, and called some imposters and some others you slew."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say: &quot;Our hearts are enfolded in covers.&quot; In fact God has cursed them for their unbelief; and only a little do they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when the Book was sent to them by God verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers and even though they recognised it when it came to them, they renounced it. The curse of God be on those who deny!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They bartered their lives ill denying the revelation of God out of spite that God should bestow His grace among His votaries on whomsoever He will, and thus earned wrath upon wrath. The punishment for disbelievers is ignominious."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when it is said to them: &quot;believe in what God has sent down,&quot; they say: &quot;We believe what was sent to us, and do not believe what has come thereafter,&quot; although it affirms the truth they possess already. Say: &quot;Why have you then been slaying God's apostles as of old, if you do believe?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Although Moses had come to you with evidence of the truth, you chose the calf in his absence, and you transgressed."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Remember when We took your pledge and exalted you on the Mount (saying:) &quot;Hold fast to what We have given you, firmly, and pay heed,&quot; you said: &quot;We have heard and will not obey.&quot; (The image of) the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief. Say: &quot;Vile is your belief if you are believers indeed!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Tell them: &quot;If you think you alone will abide with God to the exclusion of the rest of Mankind, in the mansions of the world to come, then wish for death if what you say is true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past; and God knows the sinners well."/>
		<aya index="96" text="You will see they are covetous of life more than other men, even more than those who practise idolatry. Each one of them desires to live a thousand years, although longevity will never save them from punishment, for God sees all they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say: &quot;Whosoever is the enemy of Gabriel who revealed the word of God to you by the dispensation of God, reaffirming what had been revealed before, and is a guidance and good news for those who believe, --"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Whosoever is the enemy of God and His angels and apostles, and of Gabriel and Michael, then God is the enemy of such unbelievers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We have sent clear signs to you, such as none can deny except those who transgress the truth."/>
		<aya index="100" text="And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe."/>
		<aya index="101" text="When a messenger was sent to them by God affirming the Books they had already received, some of them put (His message) behind their backs as if they had no knowledge of it."/>
		<aya index="102" text="And they follow what devilish beings used to chant against the authority of Solomon, though Solomon never disbelieved and only the devils denied, who taught sorcery to men, which, they said, had been revealed to the angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut, who, however, never taught it without saying: &quot;We have been sent to deceive you, so do not renounce (your faith).&quot; They learnt what led to discord between husband and wife. Yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of God. And they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain. They knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come, and that surely they had sold themselves for something that was vile. If only they had sense!"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Had they come to believe instead, and taken heed for themselves, they would surely have earned from God a far better reward. If only they had sense!"/>
		<aya index="104" text="Say not (to the Prophet), O Believers: &quot;Have regard for us (ra'ina),&quot; but &quot;look at us (unzurna),&quot; and obey him in what he says. Painful is the nemesis for disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Those without faith among the people of the Book, and those who worship idols, do not wish that good should come to you from your Lord. But God chooses whom He likes for His grace; and the bounty of God is infinite."/>
		<aya index="106" text="When We cancel a message (sent to an earlier prophet) or throw it into oblivion, We replace it with one better or one similar. Do you not know that God has power over all things?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that there is none to save and protect you apart from God?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Do you too, O believers, wish to question your Apostle as Moses was in the past? But he who takes unbelief in exchange for belief only strays from the right path."/>
		<aya index="109" text="How many of the followers of the Books having once known the truth desire in their hearts, out of envy, to turn you into infidels again even after the truth has become clear to them! But you forbear and overlook till God fulfil His plan; and God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat. And what you send ahead of good you will find with God, for He sees all that you do ill."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say: &quot;None will go to Paradise but the Jews and the Christians;&quot; but this is only wishful thinking. Say: &quot;Bring the proof if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Only he who surrenders to God with all his heart and also does good, will find his reward with his Lord, and will have no fear or regret."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say: &quot;The Christians are not right,&quot; and the Christians say: &quot;The Jews are in the wrong;&quot; yet both read the Scriptures; and this is what the unread had said too. God alone will judge between them in their differences on the Day of Reckoning."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of God being used in His mosques, who hurries to despoil them even though he has no right to enter them except in reverence? For them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come."/>
		<aya index="115" text="To God belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn the glory of God is everywhere: All-pervading is He and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="Yet they say that God has begotten a son. May He be praised! Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, He has only to say when He wills a thing: &quot;Be&quot;, and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="But those who are ignorant say: &quot;Why does God not speak or show us a sign?&quot; The same question had been asked by men before them, who were like them in their hearts. But to those who are firm in their faith We have shown Our signs already."/>
		<aya index="119" text="And We have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn. You will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of Hell."/>
		<aya index="120" text="The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way. Say: &quot;God's guidance alone is true guidance;&quot; for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those to whom We have sent down the Book, and who read it as it should be read, believe in it truly; but those who deny it will be losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world."/>
		<aya index="123" text="Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach."/>
		<aya index="124" text="Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: &quot;I will make you a leader among men.&quot; And when Abraham asked: &quot;From my progeny too?&quot; the Lord said: &quot;My pledge does not include transgressors.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="125" text="Remember, We made the House (of Ka'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: &quot;Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;&quot; and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham said: &quot;O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food,&quot; He answered: &quot;To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Abraham was raising the plinth of the House with Ishmael, (he prayed): &quot;Accept this from us, O Lord, for You hear and know everything;"/>
		<aya index="128" text="And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You. Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;"/>
		<aya index="129" text="And send to them, O Lord, an apostle from among them to impart Your messages to them, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and correct them in every way; for indeed You are mighty and wise."/>
		<aya index="130" text="Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul? We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,"/>
		<aya index="131" text="(For) when his Lord said to him: &quot;Obey,&quot; he replied: &quot;I submit to the Lord of all the worlds.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="132" text="And Abraham left this legacy to his sons, and to Jacob, and said: &quot;O my sons, God has chosen this as the faith for you. Do not die but as those who have submitted (to God).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="133" text="Were you present at the hour of Jacob's death? &quot;What will you worship after me?&quot; he asked his sons, and they answered: &quot;We shall worship your God and the God of your fathers, of Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the one and only God; and to Him we submit.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="134" text="Those were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. You will not be questioned about their deeds."/>
		<aya index="135" text="They say: &quot;Become Jews or become Christians, and find the right way.&quot; Say: &quot;No. We follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not an idolater.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say: &quot;We believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what had been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their progeny, and that which was given to Moses and Christ, and to all other prophets by the Lord. We make no distinction among them, and we submit to Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="137" text="If they come to believe as you did, they will find the right path. If they turn away then they will only oppose; but God will suffice you against them, for God hears all and knows everything."/>
		<aya index="138" text="&quot;We have taken the colouring of God; and whose shade is better than God's? Him alone we worship.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="139" text="Say: &quot;Why do you dispute with us about God when He is equally your Lord and our Lord? To us belong our actions, to you yours; and we are true to Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="140" text="Or do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring were Jews or Christians? Say: &quot;Have you more knowledge than God?&quot; Who is more wicked than he who conceals the testimony he received from God? God is not unaware of all you do."/>

When Abraham said: &quot;My Lord is the giver of life and death,&quot; he replied: &quot;I am the giver of life and death.&quot; And Abraham said: &quot;God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West,&quot; and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust."/>
		<aya index="259" text="Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down. He said: &quot;How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?&quot; So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: &quot;How long did you stay in this state?&quot; &quot;A day or less than a day,&quot; he replied. &quot;No,&quot; He said, &quot;you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass! We shall make you a warning for men. And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh.&quot; When this became clear to him, the man said: &quot;Indeed God has power over all things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="260" text="Remember, when Abraham said: &quot;O Lord, show me how you raise the dead,&quot; He said: &quot;What! Do you not believe?&quot; &quot;I do,&quot; answered Abraham. &quot;I only ask for my heart's assurance.&quot; (The Lord) said: &quot;Trap four birds and tame them, then put each of them on a (separate) hill, and call them, and they will come flying to you. Know that God is all-powerful and all-wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="261" text="The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly God increases for whomsoever He will, for God is infinite and all-wise."/>

		<aya index="263" text="Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts. (Do not forget that) God is affluent and kind."/>
		<aya index="264" text="O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting (your favours) like a man who spends of his wealth only to show off, but does not believe in God and the Last Day. His semblance is that of a rock covered with earth which is washed away by rain exposing the hard rock bare. So they gain nothing from their earnings. God does not guide a people who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="265" text="But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice. For God sees all that you do."/>
		<aya index="266" text="Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date-palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down? Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect."/>
		<aya index="267" text="O believers, give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what you produce from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad as alms, that is, things you would not like to accept yourself except with some condescension. Remember that God is affluent and praiseworthy."/>

		<aya index="270" text="Whatsoever you give away in alms or vow as offering, is all known to God; but the wicked will have none to help them."/>
		<aya index="271" text="If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognisant of all you do."/>
		<aya index="272" text="It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will. Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you."/>
		<aya index="273" text="(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking. You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately. God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend."/>
		<aya index="274" text="Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret."/>
		<aya index="275" text="Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented. This because they say that trading is like usury. But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God. Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God. But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever."/>
		<aya index="276" text="God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners."/>
		<aya index="277" text="Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret."/>
		<aya index="278" text="O believers, fear God and forego the interest that is owing, if you really believe."/>
		<aya index="279" text="If you do not, beware of war on the part of God and His Apostle. But if you repent, you shall keep your principal. Oppress none and no one will oppress you."/>
		<aya index="280" text="If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good, if you really understand."/>
		<aya index="281" text="Have fear of the day when you go back to God. Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged."/>
		<aya index="282" text="O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything."/>
		<aya index="283" text="If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do."/>
		<aya index="284" text="To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and whether you reveal what is in your heart or conceal it, you will have to account for it to God who will pardon whom He please and punish whom He will, for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="285" text="The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles. For they say: &quot;We hear and obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O Lord, for to You we shall journey in the end.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="286" text="God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry. Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers."/>

They say: &quot;If we had a say in the affair we would not have been killed in this place.&quot; Tell them: &quot;Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest.

		<aya index="2" text="O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God, nor the rites of the holy month, nor sacrificial cattle with garlands (that are brought to the Ka'bah), nor of the people who flock to the Holy House seeking the bounties of their Lord, and His pleasure. Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Forbidden you is carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and whatsoever has been killed in the name of some other than God, and whatever has been strangled, or killed by a blow or a fall, or by goring, or that which has been mauled by wild beasts unless slaughtered while still alive; and that which has been slaughtered at altars is forbidden, and also dividing the meat by casting lots with arrows. All this is sinful. Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your system of belief and bestowed My favours upon you in full, and have chosen submission (al-Islam) as the creed for you. If one of you is driven by hunger (to eat the forbidden) without the evil intent of sinning, then God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="4" text="They ask you what is lawful for them. Say: &quot;All things are lawful for you that are clean, and what the trained hunting animals take for you as you have trained then, in the light of God's teachings, but read over them the name of God, and fear (straying from the path of) God, for God is swift in the reckoning.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="5" text="On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries. Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come."/>
		<aya index="6" text="O believers, when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and hands up to elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of seminal pollution, then bathe and purify yourself well. But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have satisfied the call of nature, or have slept with a woman, and you cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and your hands, for God does not wish to impose any hardship on you. He wishes to purify you, and grace you with His favours in full so that you may be grateful."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Remember the favours He bestowed on you, and the covenant He cemented with you, when you said: &quot;We have heard and obey.&quot; Have fear of God, for He knows the secrets of your heart."/>
		<aya index="8" text="O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just: This is closest to piety; and beware of God. Surely God is aware of all you do."/>
		<aya index="9" text="God has made a promise of forgiveness and the highest reward to those who believe and perform good deeds."/>
		<aya index="10" text="But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are the people of Hell."/>
		<aya index="11" text="O believers, remember the favours God bestowed on you when a people raised their hands against you and He restrained their hands. So fear God; and the faithful should place their trust in God."/>
		<aya index="12" text="God covenanted the people of Israel and raised twelve leaders among them, and said: &quot;I shall verily be with you. If you fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat and believe in My apostles and support them, and give a goodly loan to God, I shall certainly absolve you of your evil, and admit you to gardens with streams of running water. But whosoever among you denies after this, will have wandered away from the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="When they dishonoured their pledge We condemned them, and hardened their hearts. So they distort the words of the Scripture out of context, and have forgotten some of what they were warned against. You will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few. But forbear and forgive them, for God loves those who do good."/>
		<aya index="14" text="We had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves Christians. But they too forgot to take advantage of the warning they were given. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of what they were doing."/>
		<aya index="15" text="O people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you, announcing many things of the Scriptures that you have suppressed, passing over some others. To you has come light and a clear Book from God"/>
		<aya index="16" text="Through which God will lead those who follow His pleasure to the path of peace, and guide them out of darkness into light by His will, and to the path that is straight."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Verily they are unbelievers who say: &quot;The Messiah, son of Mary, is God.&quot; You ask them: &quot;Who could prevail against God if He had chosen to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and the rest of mankind?&quot; For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them. He creates what He please, for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Say the Jews and the Christians: &quot;We are sons of God and beloved of Him.&quot; Say: &quot;Why does He punish you then for your sins? No: You are only mortals, of His creation.&quot; He can punish whom He please and pardon whom He will, for God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and everything will go back to Him."/>
		<aya index="19" text="O you people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you when apostles had ceased to come long ago, lest you said: &quot;There did not come to us any messenger of good news or of warnings.&quot; So now there has reached you a bearer of good tidings and of warnings; for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Remember when Moses said to his people: &quot;O my people, remember the favours that God bestowed on you when He appointed apostles from among you, and made you kings and gave you what had never been given to any one in the world."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Enter then, my people, the Holy Land that God has ordained for you, and do not turn back, or you will suffer.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="They said: &quot;O Moses, in that land live a people who are formidable; we shall never go there until they leave. We shall enter when they go away.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="Then two of the men who feared (God), and to whom God was gracious, said to them: &quot;Charge and rush the gate. If you enter, you will surely be victorious. And place your trust in God if you truly believe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="They said: &quot;O Moses, we shall never, never enter so long as they are there. Go you and your Lord to fight them; we stay here.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Said (Moses): &quot;O Lord, I have control over none but myself and my brother; so distinguish between us and these, the wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="(And God) said: &quot;Then verily this land is forbidden them for forty years, and they shall wander perplexed over the earth. So do not grieve for these, the wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of Adam. When each of them offered a sacrifice (to God), that of one was accepted, and that of the other was not. Said (the one): &quot;I will murder you,&quot; and the other replied: &quot;God only accepts from those who are upright and preserve themselves from evil."/>
		<aya index="28" text="If you raise your hand to kill me, I will raise not mine to kill you, for I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="I would rather you suffered the punishment for sinning against me, and for your own sin, and became an inmate of Hell. And that is the requital for the unjust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother, and he killed him, and became one of the damned."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Then God sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how to hide the nakedness of his brother. &quot;Alas, the woe,&quot; said he, &quot;that I could not be even like the raven and hide the nakedness of my brother,&quot; and was filled with remorse."/>
		<aya index="32" text="That is why We decreed for the children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being, except (as punishment) for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, it shall be like killing all humanity; and whosoever saves a life, saves the entire human race. Our apostles brought clear proofs to them; but even after that most of them committed excesses in the land."/>
		<aya index="33" text="The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Prophet, and perpetrate disorders in the land, is to kill or hang them, or have a hand on one side and a foot on the other cut off, or banish them from the land. Such is their disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter their doom shall be dreadful."/>
		<aya index="34" text="But those who repent before they are subdued should know that God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="35" text="O you who believe, follow the path shown to you by God, and seek the way of proximity to Him, and struggle in His way: you may have success."/>
		<aya index="36" text="As for unbelievers, if they possess the riches of the whole earth, and two times more, and offer it as ransom for release from the torments of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and their punishment will surely be painful."/>
		<aya index="37" text="They would like to escape from the Fire, but will never succeed, and their suffering will be constant"/>
		<aya index="38" text="As for the thief, whether man or woman, cut his hand as punishment from God for what he had done; and God is all mighty and all wise."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But those who repent after a crime and reform, shall be forgiven by God, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He will, and pardons whom He please, for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Be not grieved, O Apostle, by those who hasten to outrace others in denial, and say with their tongues: &quot;We believe,&quot; but do not believe in their hearts. And those of the Jews who listen to tell lies, and spy on behalf of others who do not come to you, and who distort the words (of the Torah) out of context, and say: &quot;If you are given (what we say is true) accept it; but if you are not given it, beware.&quot; You cannot intercede with God for him whom God would not show the way. These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify. For them is ignominy in this world and punishment untold in the next --"/>
		<aya index="42" text="Eavesdropping for telling lies, earning through unlawful means! So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline. And if you decline, they can do you no harm; but if you judge, you should do so with justice, for God loves those who are just."/>
		<aya index="43" text="But why should they make you a judge when the Torah is with them which contains the Law of God? Even then they turn away. They are those who will never believe."/>
		<aya index="44" text="We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient (to God) gave instructions to the Jews, as did the rabbis and priests, for they were the custodians and witnesses of God's writ. So, therefore, do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by God's revelations are infidels indeed."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retribution, though he who forgoes it out of charity, atones for his sins. And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Later, in the train (of the prophets), We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah which had been (Sent down) before him, and gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, which corroborated the earlier Torah, a guidance and warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Let the people of the Gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by God. And those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are transgressors."/>
		<aya index="48" text="And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God. If they turn away, then know that God is sure to punish them for some of their sins; and many of them are transgressors."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance? But who could be a better judge than God for those who are firm in their faith?"/>
		<aya index="51" text="O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust."/>
		<aya index="52" text="You will notice that those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness (of doubt) only hasten to join them and say: &quot;We fear lest misfortune should surround us.&quot; It may well be that God may soon send (you) success, or other command of His. Then will they be repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Then the believers will say: &quot;Are these the people who had sworn by God on solemn oath and said: &quot;We are surely with you?&quot; Wasted have been all their deeds, and losers they remain."/>
		<aya index="54" text="O believers, any one of you who turns back on his faith (should remember) that God could verily bring (in your place) another people whom He would love as they would love Him, gentle with believers, unbending with infidels, who would strive in the way of God, unafraid of blame by any slanderer. Such is the favour of God which He bestows on whomsoever He will. God is infinite and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Your only friends are God and His Messenger, and those who believe and are steadfast in devotion, who pay the zakat and bow in homage (before God)."/>
		<aya index="56" text="And those who take God and His Prophet and the faithful as their friends are indeed men of God, who will surely be victorious."/>
		<aya index="57" text="O believers, do not make friends with those who mock and make a sport of your faith, who were given the Book before you, and with unbelievers; and fear God if you truly believe;"/>
		<aya index="58" text="(Nor make friends with) those who, when you call (the faithful) to prayer, make mock of it and jest, because they do not understand."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Say to them: &quot;O people of the Book, what reason have you for disliking us other than that we believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Say: &quot;Shall I inform you who will receive the worst chastisement from God? They who were condemned by God, and on whom fell His wrath, and those who were turned to apes and swine, and those who worship the powers of evil. They are in the worse gradation, and farthest away from the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="When they come to you they say: &quot;We believe;&quot; but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go; and God is aware of what they conceal in their hearts."/>
		<aya index="62" text="You will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness, and devour unlawful gain. How evil are the things they do!"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain? Evil are the acts they commit!"/>
		<aya index="64" text="The Jews say: &quot;Bound are the hands of God.&quot; Tied be their own hands, and damned may they be for saying what they say! In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please. But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt."/>
		<aya index="65" text="If the people of the Book had believed and feared, We would surely have absolved them of their sins, and admitted them to gardens of delight."/>
		<aya index="66" text="And if they had followed the teachings of the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them by their Lord, they would surely have enjoyed (blessings) from the heavens above and the earth below their feet."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Some among them are moderate, but evil is what most of them do! O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message. God will preserve you from (the mischief of) men; for God does not guide those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Say to them: &quot;O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord.&quot; But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="69" text="All those who believe, and the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, in fact any one who believes in God and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, will have nothing to fear or regret."/>
		<aya index="70" text="We had taken a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and sent messengers to them; but whenever an apostle came to them bringing what did not suit their mood, they called one imposter, another they slew,"/>
		<aya index="71" text="And imagined that no trials would befall them; and they turned deaf and blind (to the truth). But God still turned to them; yet many of them turned blind and deaf again; but God sees everything they do."/>
		<aya index="72" text="They are surely infidels who say: &quot;God is the Christ, son of Mary.&quot; But the Christ had only said: &quot;O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord.&quot; Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them."/>
		<aya index="73" text="Disbelievers are they surely who say: &quot;God is the third of the trinity;&quot; but there is no god other than God the one. And if they do not desist from saying what they say, then indeed those among them who persist in disbelief will suffer painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Why do they not turn to God and ask His forgiveness? God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="75" text="The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle, and many apostles had (come and) gone before him; and his mother was a woman of truth. They both ate the (same) food (as men). Behold, how We show men clear signs, and behold, how they wander astray!"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Tell them: &quot;Leaving God aside, will you worship something that has no power over your loss or gain?&quot; But God is all-hearing and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="77" text="Tell them: &quot;O people of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of truth in your beliefs, and follow not the wishes of a people who had erred before, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Cursed were disbelievers among the children of Israel by David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they rebelled and transgressed the bounds."/>
		<aya index="79" text="They did not restrain one another from the wicked things they used to do; and vile were the things that they were doing!"/>
		<aya index="80" text="You can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels. Vile it was what they sent ahead of them, so that God's indignation came upon them; and torment will they suffer an eternity."/>
		<aya index="81" text="If they had believed in God and the Prophet and what had been revealed to him, they would never have held them as allies; and many among them are transgressors."/>
		<aya index="82" text="You will find the Jews and idolaters most excessive in hatred of those who believe; and the closest in love to the faithful are the people who say: &quot;We are the followers of Christ,&quot; because there are priests and monks among them, and they are not arrogant."/>
		<aya index="83" text="For when they listen to what has been revealed to this Apostle, you can see their eyes brim over with tears at the truth which they recognise, and say: &quot;O Lord, we believe; put us down among those who bear witness (to the truth)."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And why should we not believe in God and what has come down to us of the truth? And we hope to be admitted by our Lord among those who are upright and do good?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="85" text="God will reward them for saying so with gardens where streams flow by, where they will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who do good."/>
		<aya index="86" text="But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are residents of Hell."/>
		<aya index="87" text="O believers, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful for you; and do not transgress. God does not love transgressors."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Eat what is lawful and good of the provisions God has bestowed on you, and fear God in whom you believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="God does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest. The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. But he who cannot do so should fast for three days. This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it. So abide by your oaths. Thus God makes His commandments clear to you: You may perhaps be grateful."/>
		<aya index="90" text="O believers, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them. You may haply prosper."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer. Will you therefore not desist?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Obey God and the Prophet, and beware. If you turn away, remember, that the duty of Our Apostle is to give you a clear warning."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Those who believe and perform good deeds will not be held guilty for what they have eaten (in the past) if they fear God and believe, and do good things and are conscious (of God) and believe, and still fear and do good, for God loves those who do good."/>
		<aya index="94" text="O you who believe, God will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands or your lances, in order to know who fear Him unseen. Whosoever transgress after this will suffer grievous punishment."/>
		<aya index="95" text="O you who believe, do not kill game when you are on pilgrimage. And anyone among you who does so on purpose should offer livestock of equivalent value, determined by two honourable persons among you, (as atonement), to be brought to the Ka'bah as an offering; or else expiate by giving food to the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may realise the gravity of his deed. God has forgiven what has happened in the past; but any one who does so again will be punished by God. And God is severe in requital."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Lawful is all game of the water for you, and eating of it as food, so that you and the travellers may benefit by it. But unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage. Fear God before whom you have to gather in the end."/>
		<aya index="97" text="God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Know that the punishment of God is severe, but that God is also forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="99" text="It is for the Prophet to convey the message: God knows what you reveal and what you hide."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Tell them: &quot;The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you.&quot; So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success."/>
		<aya index="101" text="O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you. God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards."/>
		<aya index="103" text="God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense."/>
		<aya index="104" text="When you say to them: &quot;Come to what God has revealed, and the Prophet,&quot; they say: &quot;Sufficient to us is the faith that our fathers had followed,&quot; even though their fathers had no knowledge or guidance."/>
		<aya index="105" text="O you who believe, on you rests (the responsibility) for your own selves. If you follow the right path those who have gone astray will not be able to do you harm. To God have all of you to return, when He will tell you what you were doing."/>
		<aya index="106" text="O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours. Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: &quot;We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="107" text="If it transpires they have concealed the truth, two of those who are immediately concerned should take their place and swear by God: &quot;Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have stated no more (than the truth), or else we shall be unjust&quot;"/>
		<aya index="108" text="It is thus likely that men will bear witness rightly, or else fear that their oaths may be disproved by oaths given after them. So fear God, and do not forget that God does not guide the iniquitous."/>
		<aya index="109" text="The day God will gather the apostles and ask: &quot;What answer was made to you?&quot; They will say: &quot;We know not. You alone know the secrets unknown.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="110" text="And when God will say: &quot;O Jesus, son of Mary, remember the favours I bestowed on you and your mother, and reinforced you with divine grace that you spoke to men when in the cradle, and when in the prime of life; when I taught you the law and the judgement and the Torah and the Gospel; when you formed the state of your people's destiny out of mire and you breathed (a new spirit) into it, and they rose by My leave; when you healed the blind by My leave, and the leper; when you put life into the dead by My will; and when I held back the children of Israel from you when you brought to them My signs, and the disbelievers among them said: &quot;Surely these are nothing but pure magic.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="111" text="And when I inspired the disciples (through Jesus) to believe in Me and My apostle, they said: &quot;We believe, and You bear witness that we submit&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="When the disciples said: &quot;O Jesus, son of Mary, could your Lord send down for us a table laid with food?&quot; he said: &quot;Fear God, if indeed you believe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="113" text="They said: &quot;We should like to eat of it to reassure our hearts and to know that it's the truth you have told us, and that we should be witness to it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="114" text="Said Jesus, son of Mary. &quot;O God, our Lord, send down a table well laid out with food from the skies so that this day may be a day of feast for the earlier among us and the later, and a token from You. Give us our (daily) bread, for You are the best of all givers of food.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="115" text="And said God: &quot;I shall send it down to you; but if any of you disbelieve after this, I shall inflict such punishment on him as I never shall inflict on any other creature.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="116" text="And when God will ask: &quot;O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?' (Jesus) will answer: &quot;Halleluja. Could I say what I knew I had no right (to say)? Had I said it You would surely have known, for You know what is in my heart though I know not what You have. You alone know the secrets unknown."/>
		<aya index="117" text="I said nought to them but what You commanded me: Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And so long as I dwelt with them I was witness over their actions. And after my life had been done, You were their keeper; and You are a witness over all things."/>
		<aya index="118" text="If You punish them, indeed they are Your creatures; if You pardon them, indeed You are mighty and wise.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="4" text="Yet no sign of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it."/>
		<aya index="5" text="So they disbelieved the truth when it came to them; but they will soon come to know the reality of what they had ridiculed."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Do they not see how many generations We laid low before them, whom We had firmly established in the land as We have not established you, and showered abundant rain on them, and made rivers lap at their feet, yet whom We destroyed for their sins, and raised new generations after them?"/>
		<aya index="7" text="Even if We had sent you a transcript on paper which they could feel with their hands, the unbelievers would have said: &quot;This is nothing but clear sorcery.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="12" text="And ask: &quot;To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?&quot; Say: &quot;To God.&quot; He has prescribed grace for Himself. He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come. Only they who are lost of soul will not come to believe."/>

		<aya index="19" text="Ask: &quot;Of all things what is most vital as evidence?&quot; Say: &quot;God (who) is witness between you and me that this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may warn you on its strength, and those whom it reaches. Do you really bear witness there are other gods with God?&quot; Tell them: &quot;I bear no such Witness.&quot; Say: &quot;Verily He is the only God, and I am clear of what you associate (with Him).&quot;"/>

		<aya index="25" text="There are some among them who listen to you; but We have put a covering on their hearts so that they fail to understand it, and a deafness appears in their ears.

		<aya index="31" text="They are surely lost who call the meeting with God a lie. When the Hour comes upon them unawares, they will say: &quot;Alas, we neglected it!&quot; and carry their burdens on their backs: How evil the burden they will carry!"/>
		<aya index="32" text="As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity. The final abode is the best for those who are pious and fear God. Do you not comprehend?"/>
		<aya index="33" text="We know what they say distresses you. It is not you in fact they accuse of lies, but the wicked deny the revelations of God!"/>
		<aya index="34" text="Many an apostle has been accused of lies before you. Yet they bore with fortitude the falsehoods and the hurt until our help arrived. There is no changing the word of God: The news of (past) apostles has come to you already."/>
		<aya index="35" text="If their aversion still weighs upon you, seek out a tunnel (going deep) into the earth, or a ladder reaching out to the skies, and bring them a sign: (Even then they will not believe). If God had willed He would have brought them all to the right path. So be not like the pagans."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Only they will respond who can hear. As for the dead, raised they will be by God, then to Him they will be returned."/>

		<aya index="38" text="There is not a thing that moves on the earth, no bird that flies on its wings, but has a community of its own like yours. There is nothing that We have left out from recording. Then they will all be gathered before their Lord."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Those who deny Our revelations are deaf, dumb, and lost in the dark. God sends whosoever He wills astray, and leads whom He will to the straight path."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Say: &quot;Have you thought if the punishment of God or the Hour (of Doom) came upon you, would you call to any other than God? Answer, if you are men of truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="41" text="No: You will call to Him alone; and He will, if He please, remove (the distress) for which you had called Him; and forget those you associate as compeers (with Him)"/>
		<aya index="42" text="We have indeed sent (apostles) to many a people before you, and inflicted upon them hardships and afflictions so that they might submit."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Then why did they not submit when Our punishment came upon them? But their hearts were hardened, and Satan made things they were doing look attractive to them."/>
		<aya index="44" text="When they had become oblivious of what they were warned, We opened wide the gates of everything to them; yet as they rejoiced at what they were given, We caught them unawares, and they were filled with despair."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Thus were the wicked people rooted out of existence to the last. All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Say: &quot;Imagine if God takes away your hearing and sight, and sets a seal on your hearts, what deity other than God will restore them to you?&quot; See how We inflect Our signs: Even then they turn aside."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Say: &quot;Imagine if the punishment of God were to come unawares, or openly, who will perish but the evil-doers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="We do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn. Then those who believe or reform will have neither fear nor regret."/>
		<aya index="49" text="But those who deny Our messages will be seized by nemesis for being disobedient."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Tell them: &quot;I do not say that I possess the treasures of God, or have knowledge of the Unknown, or that I am an angel. I only follow what is sent down to me.&quot; And say: &quot;How can a blind man and a man who can see, be alike? Will you not reflect?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Warn those who fear, through this (Qur'an), that they will be gathered before their Lord, and they will have none to protect or intercede for them apart from Him. They may haply take heed for themselves."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Do not turn away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. You are not accountable for them in the least, nor they for you at all. If you drive them away you will only be unjust."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Thus do We try men through one another so that they may ask: &quot;Are these the ones of all of us who have been favoured by God?&quot; Does God not know who are the grateful?"/>
		<aya index="54" text="When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say to them: &quot;Peace on you.&quot; Your Lord has prescribed grace for Himself, so that in case one of you commits evil out of ignorance, then feels repentant and reforms, He may be forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Thus distinctly do We explain Our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Tell them: &quot;I am forbidden to worship those you invoke apart from God.&quot; And say: &quot;I will not follow your wishes. If I do, I shall be lost and not be one of those who follow the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="57" text="Tell them: &quot;A clear proof has come to me from my Lord, and Him you deny. But what you wish to be hastened is not within my power. The judgement is only God's. He unfolds the Truth, and is the best of judges.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="58" text="Say: &quot;If what you wish to be hastened were in my power, all matters between you and me would have been settled; God is cognisant of those who are unjust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="He has the keys of the Unknown. No one but He has knowledge; He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkest (recess) of the earth, nor any thing green or seared that is not recorded in the open book (of nature)."/>
		<aya index="60" text="It is He indeed who sends you to death at night, and knows what you do in the day, then makes you rise with it again in order that the fixed term of life be fulfilled. Then to Him you will be returned when He will tell you what you did."/>
		<aya index="61" text="He has power over His creatures, and appoints guardians to watch over them. When death comes to one of you, Our messengers take away his soul, and do not falter."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Then they are taken to God, their real lord and master. His indeed is the judgement; and He is swift at reckoning."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Ask: &quot;Who is it who comes to your rescue in the darkness of the desert and the sea, and whom you supplicate humbly and unseen: 'If You deliver us from this, we shall indeed he grateful?'"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Say: &quot;God delivers you from this and every calamity. Even then you ascribe compeers (to Him)!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="Say: &quot;He has power to send you retribution from the skies above, or the earth beneath your feet, or confound you with divisions among you, and give one the taste of the vengeance of the other.&quot; See, how distinctly We explain Our signs that they may understand."/>
		<aya index="66" text="This (Book) has been called by your people a falsehood though it is the truth. Say: &quot;I am not a warden over you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="A time is fixed for every prophecy; you will come to know in time."/>
		<aya index="68" text="When you see them argue about Our messages, withdraw from their company until they begin to talk of other things. In case the Devil makes you forget, leave the company of these unjust people the moment you remember this."/>
		<aya index="69" text="As for the heedful and devout, they are not accountable for them, but should give advice: They may haply come to fear God."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Leave those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith, and have been seduced by the life of this world. Remind them hereby lest a man is doomed for what he has done. He will have none to help him, or intercede for him, other than God; and even if he offer all the ransoms they will not be accepted from him. They are those who will be destroyed by their own acts. There will be scalding water to drink for them and painful punishment, for they had disbelieved."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Say: 'Should we call in place of God one who can neither help nor do us harm, and turn back after having been guided by God, like a man beguiled by the devils who wanders perplexed in the wilderness while his friends call him back to the right path, saying: 'Come to us, this way?' Say: &quot;God's guidance is (true) guidance, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Observe (your) devotional obligations and fear (God), for it is He before whom you will be gathered (in the end).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="It is He who created the heavens and the earth with a definite purpose. The day He will say &quot;Be, &quot; it will be. His word is the truth, His alone the power on the Day when the blast of the trumpet will be sounded. He knows the hidden and the visible. He is all-prudent and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Remember when Abraham said to Azar, his father: &quot;Why do you take idols for God? I certainly find you and your people in error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="Thus We showed to Abraham the visible and invisible world of the heavens and the earth, that he could be among those who believe."/>
		<aya index="76" text="When the night came with her covering of darkness he saw a star, and (Azar, his father) said: &quot;This is my Lord.&quot; But when the star set, (Abraham) said: &quot;I love not those that wane.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="When (Azar) saw the moon rise all aglow, he said: &quot;This is my Lord.&quot; But even as the moon set, (Abraham) said: &quot;If my Lord had not shown me the way I would surely have gone astray.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="When (Azar) saw the sun rise all resplendent, he said: &quot;My Lord is surely this, and the greatest of them all.&quot; But the sun also set, and (Abraham) said: &quot;O my people, I am through with those you associate (with God)."/>
		<aya index="79" text="I have truly turned my face towards Him who created the heavens and the earth: I have chosen one way and am not an idolater.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="His people argued, and he said: &quot;Do you argue with me about God? He has guided me already, and I fear not what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills, for held within the knowledge of my Lord is everything. Will you not reflect?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="And why should I fear those you associate with Him when you fear not associating others with God for which He has sent down no sanction? Tell me, whose way is the way of peace, if you have the knowledge?"/>
		<aya index="82" text="They alone have peace who believe and do not intermix belief with denial, and are guided on the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="This is the argument We gave to Abraham against his people. We exalt whosoever We please in rank by degrees. Your Lord is wise and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus We reward those who are upright and do good."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Zachariah and John We guided, and guided Jesus and Elias who were all among the upright."/>
		<aya index="86" text="We gave guidance to Ishmael, Elisha and Jonah and Lot; And We favoured them over the other people of the world,"/>
		<aya index="87" text="As We did some of their fathers and progeny and brethren, and chose them, and showed them the right path."/>
		<aya index="88" text="This is God's guidance: He gives among His creatures whom He will. If they had associated others with Him, surely vain would have been all they did."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Those were the people to whom We gave the Book and the Law and the Prophethood. But if they reject these things We shall entrust them to a people who will not deny."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Those were the people who were guided by God; so follow their way. Say: &quot;I ask no recompense of you for this. It is but a reminder for all the people of the world.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="But they failed to make a just estimation of God when they said: &quot;He did not reveal to any man any thing.&quot; Ask them: &quot;Who then revealed the Book that Moses brought, -- a guidance and light for men, -- which you treat as sheafs of paper, which you display, yet conceal a great deal, though through it you were taught things you did not know before, nor even your fathers knew?&quot; Say: &quot;God,&quot; and leave them to the sport of engaging in vain discourse."/>
		<aya index="92" text="And this (Qur'an) is another Book that We have revealed, blessed, affirming the earlier (revelations), so that you may warn the people of (Makkah) the town of towns, and those who live around it. Those who believe in the life to come shall believe in it and be watchful of their moral obligations."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Who is more vile than he who slanders God of falsehood, or says: &quot;Revelation came to me,&quot; when no such revelation came to him; or one who claims: &quot;I can reveal the like of what has been sent down by God?&quot; If you could see the evil creatures in the agony of death with the angels thrusting forward their hands (saying): &quot;Yield up your souls: This day you will suffer ignominious punishment for uttering lies about God and rejecting His signs with arrogance.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="&quot;You have come before Us all alone,&quot; (God will say), &quot;as when you were created first, leaving behind all that We had bestowed on you. We do not see your intercessors with you who, you imagined, had partnership with you. Shattered lie your ties with them now, and gone are the claims you made.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="Indeed it is God who splits up the seed and the kernel, and brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living. This is God: So whither do you stray?"/>
		<aya index="96" text="He ushers in the dawn, and made the night for rest, the sun and moon a computation. Such is the measure appointed by Him, the omnipotent and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="97" text="It is He who made the stars by which you reckon your way through the darkness of the desert and the sea. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who recognise."/>
		<aya index="98" text="It is He who produced you from a single cell, and appointed a place of sojourning, (the womb of the mother), and a place of depositing, (the grave). How clear have We made Our signs for those who understand."/>
		<aya index="99" text="It is He who sends down water from the skies, and brings out of it everything that grows, the green foliage, the grain lying close, the date palm trees with clusters of dates, and the gardens of grapes, and of olives and pomegranates, so similar yet so unlike. Look at the fruits, how they appear on the trees, and they ripen. In all these are signs for those who believe."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Yet they ascribe to jinns a partnership with God, although He created them; and they ascribe to Him sons and daughters, without possessing any knowledge. All praise be to Him. He is much too exalted for things they associate (with Him)."/>
		<aya index="101" text="Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, how could He have a son when He has no mate? He created all things, and has knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="102" text="This is God, your Lord; there is no god but He, the creator of all things. So pay homage to Him, for He takes care of everything."/>
		<aya index="103" text="No eyes can penetrate Him, but He penetrates all eyes, and He knows all the mysteries, for He is all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="104" text="To you have come signs from your Lord, (and the light of understanding). So any one who sees (and understands) does so for himself, and any one who turns blind shall suffer the consequences alone. (Say:) &quot;I am not a guardian over you (to make you understand).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="105" text="Thus in varied ways We explain Our signs so that they may say: &quot;You have been instructed,&quot; and that We might make it clear to those who understand."/>
		<aya index="106" text="So follow what is sent down to you by your Lord, for homage is due to no one but God, and turn away from idolaters."/>

		<aya index="108" text="Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance. We have made attractive their deeds to every people. They have to go back to their Lord, when He will tell them what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="109" text="They solemnly swear by God: &quot;If a sign comes to us we shall certainly believe in it.&quot; Tell them: &quot;The signs are with God.&quot; Yet for all you know they will not believe if the signs came to them."/>
		<aya index="110" text="We shall turn their hearts and their eyes, for they did not believe them at the very first, and leave them to wander perplexed in bewilderment."/>
		<aya index="111" text="Even if We send down the angels to them, and the dead should speak to them, and We gather all things before their eyes, they will not believe, unless God should will, for most of them are ignorant."/>
		<aya index="112" text="That is how We have made for each apostle opponents, the satans among men and jinns, who inspire one another with deceitful talk. But if your Lord had willed they would not have done so. Pay no attention to them and to what they fabricate."/>
		<aya index="113" text="Let those who do not believe in the life to come, listen to it and be pleased with it, and let them gain what they may gain."/>
		<aya index="114" text="(Say): &quot;Then should I seek (the source of) law elsewhere than God, when it is He who has revealed this Book to you, which distinctly explains (everything)?&quot; Those to whom We have given the Book know it has been sent by your Lord in truth. So be not a sceptic."/>
		<aya index="115" text="Perfected are the laws of your Lord in truth and justice, and there is no changing His laws. He is all-hearing and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="If you follow the majority of people on the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of God, for they follow only conjecture and surmise."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Your Lord surely knows those who have strayed from his path, and knows those who are rightly guided."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Eat only that over which the name of God has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His commands."/>
		<aya index="119" text="And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so. Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge. Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Discard both the visible and invisible sin. For those who sin will be punished for what they have done."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Do not eat of that over which God's name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law. Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And thus have We placed in every city the greatest of the sinners to contrive and deceive; yet they contrive against no one but themselves even though they do not know."/>
		<aya index="124" text="Every time a sign comes to them they say: &quot;We shall never believe till what God's apostles had been given comes to us.&quot; God knows best where to direct His messages. A degradation will befall the sinners and chastisement from God for deceiving."/>
		<aya index="125" text="Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="126" text="This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect."/>
		<aya index="127" text="For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their defender as reward for what they did."/>
		<aya index="128" text="On the day He will gather them together, (He will say:) &quot;O you assembly of jinns, you made great use of men.&quot; But their proteges among men will say: &quot;O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us.&quot; &quot;Your abode is Hell,&quot; He will say, &quot;where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise.&quot; Verily your Lord is wise and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="129" text="Thus do We place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds."/>
		<aya index="130" text="O you assembly of jinns and men, did not apostles come to you from among you, communicating My signs to you, bringing warnings of this your day (of Doom)?&quot; They will answer: &quot;We bear witness to our sins.&quot; They were surely deluded by the life of the world, and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="131" text="And this (so that it may be clear) that your Lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware."/>
		<aya index="132" text="Every one has his place according to his deeds, for your Lord is not negligent of what you do."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Your Lord is all-sufficient and full of benevolence. He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others."/>

		<aya index="136" text="They allocate a share from God's own created fields and cattle to God, and they say: &quot;This is God's&quot; -- or so they think -- &quot;and that, of the compeers of God,&quot; so that what belongs to the compeers does not reach God, but that which is God's may reach the compeers (set up by them). How bad is the judgement that they make!"/>
		<aya index="137" text="In the same way have their companions shown many unbelievers the killing of their children as desirable in order to ruin them and falsify their faith. If God had so willed they would never have done so. Leave them to their falsehoods."/>

None may eat of them other than those we permit,&quot; -- so they assert. &quot;And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden.&quot; They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for what they fabricate."/>
		<aya index="139" text="And they say: &quot;Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is only meant for men and forbidden our women; but in case it should be still-born both could eat it.&quot; God will punish them for what they assert. He is all-wise and all-knowing."/>

		<aya index="141" text="It is He who grew the gardens, trellised and bowered, and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds, and olives and pomegranates, alike and yet unlike. So eat of their fruit when they are in fruit, and give on the day of harvesting His due, and do not be extravagant, for God does not love those who are prodigal."/>
		<aya index="142" text="He has created beasts of burden and cattle for slaughter. So eat of what God has given you for food, and do not walk in the footsteps of Satan who is surely your declared enemy."/>
		<aya index="143" text="There are eight pairs, two of the species of sheep and two of goats. Ask them which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs? Produce the sanction if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="144" text="And there are two of camels and two of oxen. Ask them: &quot;Which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?&quot; Were you present at the time God issued this command?&quot; Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge? God does not guide the miscreants."/>
		<aya index="145" text="You tell them: &quot;In all the commands revealed to me I find nothing which men have been forbidden to eat except carrion and running blood and flesh of the swine for it is unclean, or meat consecrated in the name of some other than God, which is profane. But if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it, then surely your Lord is forgiving and kind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="146" text="We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones. This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true."/>
		<aya index="147" text="If they call you a liar, tell them infinite is the mercy of your Lord; but His vengeance will not be turned back from the sinners."/>
		<aya index="148" text="But the idolaters say: &quot;If God had so willed we would not have associated (others with Him), nor would have our fathers, nor would we have forbidden any thing.&quot; So had others denied before them, and had to taste Our punishment in the end. Ask them: &quot;Have you any knowledge? Then display it. You follow nothing but conjecture, and are nothing but liars.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="149" text="Say: &quot;To God belongs the consummate argument. Had He willed He would surely have guided all of you aright.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="150" text="Tell them: &quot;Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden this (and this).&quot; Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord."/>
		<aya index="151" text="Tell them: &quot;Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause. These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand."/>
		<aya index="152" text="Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance. God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God. These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed."/>
		<aya index="153" text="(He has further commanded:) 'This is My straight path, so walk along it, and do not follow other ways, lest you should turn away from the right one.' All this has He commanded. You may perhaps take heed for yourselves.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="157" text="Or that: &quot;Had the Book been sent down to us we would surely have been guided better than they.&quot; So you have now received from your Lord a clear proof and a guidance and grace. Then who is more wicked than he who denies the signs of God and turns away from them? We shall punish those severely who turn away: A requital indeed for having turned aside."/>
		<aya index="158" text="What are the people waiting for? For the angels to come down, or your Lord to appear, or some signs from your Lord? The day when certain signs appear from your Lord, the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first, or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith. Tell them: &quot;Wait on, we are waiting too (for the good and evil to become distinct).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="159" text="As for those who have created schisms in their order, and formed different sects, you have no concern with them. Their affair is with God. He will tell them the truth of what they were doing."/>

		<aya index="162" text="Tell them: &quot;My service and sacrifice, my life and my death, are all of them for God, the creator and Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="163" text="No equal has He, I am commanded (to declare), and that I am the first to submit.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="164" text="Say: &quot;Shall I search for another lord apart from God when He is the only Lord of all and everything?&quot; Each soul earns (what it earns) for itself, and no man shall bear another's burden. You have to go back to your Lord in the end when He will tell you about the things you disputed."/>
		<aya index="165" text="It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you. Indeed your Lord's retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind."/>

		<aya index="69" text="Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you and warns you?

		<aya index="73" text="We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh. &quot;O you people,&quot; said he, &quot;worship God, for you have no other god but He.

		<aya index="74" text="Remember, how you were made leaders after the people of 'Ad, and were settled on the land so that you could construct on the plains palaces, and carve dwellings out of mountains. So think of the favours of God, and do not act with corruption in the land.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="The chiefs among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker ones among them who believed, asked: &quot;Do you really know that Saleh has been sent by his Lord?&quot; They said: &quot;Indeed we believe in the message he has brought.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="77" text="Then they hamstrung the she-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and said: &quot;Bring, O Saleh, on us the affliction you promise, if you are one of the sent ones.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Saleh turned away from them and said: &quot;O my people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord and warned you; but you do not like those who wish you well.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="And We sent Lot, who said to his people: &quot;Why do you commit this lecherous act which none in the world has committed before?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="In preference to women you satisfy your lust with men. Indeed you are a people who are guilty of excess.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="82" text="His people made no answer, and only said: &quot;Drive them out of the city. They profess to be pure.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="But We saved him and his family, except for his wife who was one of those who stayed behind."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And We rained down on them a shower (of Stones). So witness the end of sinners!"/>
		<aya index="85" text="Remember, We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib. &quot;O you people,&quot; he said, &quot;worship God, for you have no other god but He. Clear proof has come to you from your Lord; so give in full measure and full weight; do not keep back from people what is theirs, and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed. This is best for you if you believe."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Do not lie in ambush to intimidate and divert from the path of God those who believe in Him, nor seek obliquity in it. Remember the day when you were few and He increased your numbers. So consider the fate of those who were evil."/>
		<aya index="87" text="If some of you believe what has been sent through me, and some of you do not, have patience until God decide between us, for He is the best of all judges.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="The arrogant leaders of the people replied: &quot;We shall drive you away from our land, O Shu'aib, and those who are with you, unless you come back to your faith.&quot; But he remarked: &quot;Even if we are disgusted with it?"/>
		<aya index="89" text="We shall only be guilty of blaspheming God if we accept your way after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="The chiefs among his people who did not believe said (to them): &quot;If you follow Shu'aib and his way you will surely be ruined.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning."/>
		<aya index="92" text="They who called Shu'aib a liar (disappeared) as though they had never existed; and those who called Shu'aib a liar were the ones who were ruined!"/>
		<aya index="93" text="So Shu'aib turned away from them and said: &quot;O people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and warned you. (But you paid no heed). How can I grieve for a people who do not believe?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="There is not a region to which We sent a prophet and did not inflict upon its people adversity and hardship so that they may submit."/>
		<aya index="95" text="But when We changed hardship to ease, and they rose and prospered, (they forgot Our favours) and said: &quot;Our ancestors had also known suffering and joy.&quot; So We caught them unawares."/>
		<aya index="96" text="But if the people of these regions had believed and feared God, We would surely have showered on them blessings of the heavens and the earth; but they only denied, and We punished them for their deeds."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Are the people of the region so secure that they lie asleep unaware as Our punishment overtakes them?"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Or, are the people of the towns so unafraid that (even when) Our retribution comes upon them in the hours of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play?"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Can they remain secure against the plan of God? Only they feel secure against the plan of God who are certain of being ruined."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Do not the people who inherited the earth from the (earlier) inhabitants perceive that We could afflict them too for their sins if We pleased, and put seals on their hearts that they may not hear (the voice of truth)?"/>
		<aya index="101" text="These were the (earlier) habitations whose accounts We have given to you. Their apostles came with clear proofs, but they did not believe what they once denied. That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="102" text="We did not find many of them faithful to their promises, and found many of them disobedient."/>
		<aya index="103" text="So We sent Moses with miracles after (these apostles) to the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they behaved with them high-handedly. See then the end of the authors of evil."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Moses said: &quot;O Pharaoh, I have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds;"/>
		<aya index="105" text="&quot;I am duty bound to speak nothing of God but the truth I have brought from your Lord a clear sign; so let the people of Israel depart with me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="106" text="He said: &quot;If you have brought a sign then display it, if what you say is true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="107" text="At this Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it became a live serpent."/>
		<aya index="108" text="And he drew forth his hand, and behold, it looked white to those who beheld it."/>
		<aya index="109" text="The nobles of Pharaoh said: &quot;He surely is a clever magician."/>
		<aya index="110" text="&quot;He wishes to drive you away from the land. So what do you advise?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="111" text="They said: &quot;Put him and his brother off (awhile) and send out heralds to the cities"/>
		<aya index="112" text="&quot;To bring all the wise magicians to you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="113" text="The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said: &quot;Is there reward for us if we succeed?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="114" text="&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;you will be among the honoured.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="115" text="So they said: &quot;O Moses, you may cast your spell first, or we shall cast ours.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="116" text="&quot;You cast it first,&quot; answered Moses. When they cast their spell, they bewitched the eyes of the people and petrified them by conjuring up a great charm."/>
		<aya index="117" text="We said to Moses: &quot;Throw down your staff;&quot; and it swallowed up their conjurations in no time."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Thus the truth was upheld, and the falsehood that they practised was exposed."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown, humiliated."/>
		<aya index="120" text="The sorcerers fell to the ground in homage,"/>
		<aya index="121" text="And said: &quot;We have come to believe in the Lord of all the worlds,"/>

		<aya index="150" text="When Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: &quot;How wickedly you behaved in my absence. Why must you hasten the decree of your Lord?&quot; And he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair. &quot;O son of my mother,&quot; said (Aaron), &quot;these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me. Do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="161" text="And when it was said to them: &quot;Live in this land and eat of its produce wheresoever you like, and ask for remission of your sins, but pass through the gates with submission (and not pride), We shall forgive your trespasses, and give to those who are righteous abundance,&quot;"/>

		<aya index="65" text="O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight. If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers, for they are people devoid of understanding."/>
		<aya index="66" text="God has lightened your burden as He knows you are weak: So, if there are a hundred men of firm determination among you, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you they will vanquish two thousand by the will of God, for God is with those who are determined."/>

		<aya index="1" text="IMMUNITY is granted those idolaters by God and his Apostle with whom you have a treaty."/>
		<aya index="2" text="(They can) move about for four months freely in the land, but should know they cannot escape (the law of) God, and that God can put the unbelievers to shame."/>
		<aya index="3" text="A general proclamation is (made) this day of the Greater Pilgrimage on the part of God and His Apostle, that God is not bound (by any contract) to idolaters, nor is His Apostle. It is, therefore, better for you to repent. If you do not, remember that you cannot elude (the grip of) God. So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment,"/>
		<aya index="4" text="Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you. Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty). God loves those who take heed for themselves."/>
		<aya index="5" text="But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. But if they repent and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="6" text="If an idolater seeks protection, then give him asylum that he may hear the word of God. Then escort him to a place of safety, for they are people who do not know."/>
		<aya index="7" text="How could there be a treaty between idolaters and God and His Apostle, except those you covenanted by the Sacred Mosque? Therefore as long as they are honest with you be correct with them, for God loves those who are godly."/>
		<aya index="8" text="How (can they be trusted)? If they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you. They flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are averse to you, for most of them are iniquitous."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They barter away the words of God for a petty price, and obstruct (others) from His path. How evil indeed are the things they do!"/>
		<aya index="10" text="They have no regard for kinship or treaties with believers, for they are transgressors."/>
		<aya index="11" text="But if they repent and are firm in devotion and pay the zakat, then they are your brothers in faith. We explain Our commands distinctly for those who understand."/>
		<aya index="12" text="If they break their pledge after giving their word and revile your faith, fight these specimens of faithlessness, for surely their oaths have no sanctity: They may haply desist."/>
		<aya index="13" text="Will you not fight those who broke their pledge and plotted to banish the Apostle, and who were the first to attack you? Are you afraid of them? If you are believers you should fear God more."/>
		<aya index="14" text="Fight them so that God may punish them at your hands, and put them to shame, and help you against them, and heal the wounds of the hearts of believers,"/>
		<aya index="15" text="And remove the anger from their breasts; for God turns to whosoever desires. God is all-knowing and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Do you think you will get away before God knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but God, His Apostle and the faithful, as their friends? God is cognisant of all that you do."/>

		<aya index="18" text="Only those who believe in God and the Last Day, who fulfil their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and fear no one but God, can visit the mosques of God. They may hope to be among the guided."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Do you think that giving a drink of water to the pilgrims and going on a visit to the Sacred Mosque, is the same as believing in God and the Last Day, and striving in the cause of God? In the eyes of God it is not the same; and God does not show the unrighteous the way."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God, wealth and soul, have a greater reward with God, and will be successful."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Their Lord announces to them news of His mercy, acceptance, and gardens of lasting bliss"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Which they will enjoy for ever. Indeed God has greater rewards with Him."/>
		<aya index="23" text="O you who believe, do not hold your fathers and brothers as friends if they hold disbelief more dear than faith; and those of you who do so are iniquitous."/>
		<aya index="24" text="You tell them: &quot;If your fathers and sons, your brothers and wives and families and wealth, or the business you fear may fail, and the mansions that you love, are dearer to you than God, His Apostle, and struggling in His cause, then wait until God's command arrives, for God does not show transgressors the way.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Then God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the faithful; and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels. This is the recompense of those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Yet God may turn (even) after this to whomsoever He please, for God is compassionate and kind."/>
		<aya index="28" text="O believers, the idolaters are unclean. So they should not approach the Holy Mosque after this year. In case you fear indigence (from the stoppage of business with them), then God will enrich you of His bounty if He will, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Fight those people of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day, who do not prohibit what God and His Apostle have forbidden, nor accept divine law, until all of them pay protective tax in submission."/>
		<aya index="30" text="The Jews say: &quot;Ezra is the son of God;&quot; the Christians say: &quot;Christ is the son of God.&quot; That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them. May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!"/>
		<aya index="31" text="They consider their rabbis and monks and the Christ, son of Mary, to be gods apart from God, even though they had been enjoined to worship only one God, for there is no god but He. Too holy is He for what they ascribe to Him!"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They wish to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies; but God will not have it so, for He wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers be averse."/>
		<aya index="33" text="It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it superior to other systems of belief, even though the idolaters may not like it."/>
		<aya index="34" text="O believers, many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully, and keep men away from the path of God. To those who accumulate gold and silver, and do not spend in the way of God, announce the news of painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="35" text="On the day We shall heat up (their gold) on the fire of Hell and brand their foreheads, sides and backs (and say to them): &quot;It is this you stored up for yourselves; so now taste of what you had stored!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="The number of months with God is twelve in accordance with God's law since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these four are holy. This is the straight reckoning. So do not exceed yourselves during them; but fight the idolaters to the end as they fight you in like manner; and remember, God is with those Who preserve themselves from evil and do the right."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief. The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful. Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way."/>
		<aya index="38" text="What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag? Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come? Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Unless you go out (to strive), God will inflict grievous punishment on you, and bring other people in your place, and you will not be able to harm Him in the least, for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="40" text="If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: &quot;Do not grieve, for God is with us.&quot; Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="41" text="O believers, go out in the cause of God, (whether) light or heavy, and strive in the service of God, wealth and soul. This is better for you if you understand."/>
		<aya index="42" text="(O Prophet), had the gain been close at hand, and easy the journey, they would surely have followed you; but hard was the journey and long the going. Even then they swear by God (and say): &quot;If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you.&quot; They are only ruining themselves, for God is aware they lie."/>
		<aya index="43" text="May God forgive you. Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?"/>
		<aya index="44" text="Those who believe in God and the Last Day, do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul (in the cause of God), for God knows the pious and devout."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Only they ask (for leave) who do not believe in God and the Last Day, whose hearts are full of doubt; and doubting they waver (between gain and loss)."/>
		<aya index="46" text="If they had intended to go out (to fight) they would surely have made preparations. But God did not like their setting forth, and they were held back and told: &quot;Stay at home with those who stay behind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Had they gone out with you, they would only have been a hindrance and let loose confusion among you to create discord; for there are some in your midst who spy for them. But God knows who are the wicked."/>
		<aya index="48" text="They had tried to create disorder before and intrigued against you, but truth came out in the end and God's will prevailed, even though they did not like it."/>
		<aya index="49" text="And (many a one) there is among them who says: &quot;Allow me (to stay back at home), and put me not on trial.&quot; Surely they have put themselves on trial already, and Hell will enclose the unbelievers from all sides."/>
		<aya index="50" text="If good comes your way they are vexed, but if calamity befalls you, they say: &quot;We had taken precautions in advance;&quot; and pleased, turn away."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Tell them: &quot;Nothing can befall us except what God decrees. Our protector is He, and in God should the faithful place their trust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Say: &quot;Are you waiting for anything else but one of two good things for us, (victory or martyrdom)? Yet what we are waiting for you is the punishment of God, direct or through us. So keep waiting; we are waiting with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Tell them: &quot;You may spend (in the way of God), whether willingly or with reluctance, it will not be accepted from you, for you are reprobates.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="Nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not believe in God and His Apostle, and come to worship but languidly and spend only grudgingly."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Do not marvel at their wealth and children. God intends to punish them through these in the world; and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief."/>
		<aya index="56" text="They swear by God they are with you, though in fact they are not. They are only a frightened lot."/>
		<aya index="57" text="If they find a place of shelter or a cave or hole to hide, they will turn to it."/>
		<aya index="58" text="There are some among them who blame you (of partiality) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God. In case they receive some of these they are pleased, if not, they are incensed."/>
		<aya index="59" text="They should rather have been pleased with what God and His Prophet had given them, and said: &quot;God is sufficient for us; He will give us of His largesse as will His Apostle. We supplicate no one but God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Charities are meant for the indigent and needy, and those who collect and distribute them, and those whom you wish to win over, and for redeeming slaves (and captives) and those who are burdened with debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarers: So does God ordain. God is all-knowing and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="61" text="There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying: &quot;He listens to everyone.&quot; Tell them: &quot;He listens for your good, and trusts in God and trusts the faithful, and he is a blessing for those who believe. For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="They swear by God to please you; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet, will abide in Hell for ever? And that is the worst disgrace."/>
		<aya index="64" text="The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say to them: &quot;Mock as much as you like; God will surely expose what you dread.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="But if you ask them, they will say: &quot;We were only gossiping and jesting.&quot; You ask them: &quot;Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin)."/>
		<aya index="67" text="The hypocrites (are the same) whether men or women, the one of them being of the other. They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good, and tighten their purses (when it comes to spending in the way of God). Of God they are oblivious; so He is oblivious of them. The hypocrites are indeed transgressors."/>
		<aya index="68" text="God has reserved for hypocrites, whether men or women, and for unbelievers, the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is sufficient for them: They have God's condemnation and lasting torment,"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Like those before you who were greater in strength, had more wealth and children than you, who enjoyed their lot in this world, as you have enjoyed your share like them. You indulge in idle talk, as they had indulged in vain discourse. Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Has not the account of those before them come to them, -- of the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, of Abraham and Midian, and all the habitations that were destroyed? Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs; and God did not surely wrong them, they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Those who believe, men and women, befriend one another, and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong. They observe their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God will be merciful to them, for God is all-mighty and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="72" text="God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever, and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden, and the blessings of God above all. That will be happiness supreme."/>
		<aya index="73" text="Strive, O Prophet, against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal with them firmly. Their final abode is Hell: And what a wretched destination!"/>
		<aya index="74" text="They swear by God: &quot;We never said this.&quot; But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Some of them made a covenant with God: &quot;If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy, and then turned away."/>
		<aya index="77" text="As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God, and telling lies, he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk, and that God has the knowledge of unknown things?"/>
		<aya index="79" text="They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly, and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour (to give in charity), will be derided by God, and will suffer painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="80" text="Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not, God will not forgive them, even though you plead seventy times, for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle; and God does not show transgressors the way."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God's Apostle, being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives, and said: &quot;Do not go in this heat.&quot; Tell them: &quot;The heat of Hell is far more intense.&quot; If only they had cared to instruct themselves!"/>
		<aya index="82" text="So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done."/>
		<aya index="83" text="If you come back to them by (the grace of) God, and they seek your permission to go (to fight), you should tell them: &quot;You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more. You preferred to stay back on the first occasion, so stay at home with those who stay behind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="Do not invoke blessings on any of them who die, nor stand to pray at their graves, for they disbelieved in God and His Prophet, and died transgressors."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And let not their wealth and children astonish you. God wishes to punish them through these in the world, and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Whenever a Surah is revealed (which says): &quot;Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet,&quot; the well-to-do among them ask for leave to stay at home, and say: &quot;Leave us with those who are left behind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They prefer to be with women who (are allowed to) stay at home during war, and their hearts are sealed; so they fail to understand."/>
		<aya index="88" text="But the Prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him, and have fought wealth and soul (in the way of God), are blessed and will be successful."/>
		<aya index="89" text="God has provision for them of gardens with Streams of running water, where they will abide for ever. This will be the supreme triumph."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses, asking for leave to stay behind. But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing. So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful."/>
		<aya index="91" text="No blame will attach to the old and the sick, or those without means to spend on good acts, if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport, to whom you said: &quot;I cannot find any means of conveyance for you,&quot; and they went away in tears, grieving that they lacked the means to spend (on carriage)."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Blame will lie on those who are rich yet ask your leave to stay behind. They prefer to stay with women who stay at home, and God seals their hearts; so they do not understand."/>
		<aya index="94" text="When you come back they will offer excuses to you. Tell them: &quot;Make no excuses; we do not believe you. God has informed us about you; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct. Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest. He will tell you of what you did.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="They will beg you in the name of God, on your return, to forgive them; but you keep away from them: They are scum; their abode is Hell: Requital for what they had done."/>
		<aya index="96" text="They will plead on oath that you accept them. Even if you accept them, remember God does not accept people who are disobedient."/>
		<aya index="97" text="The village Arabs are more obstinate in disbelief and hypocrisy, and impervious to ordinances revealed to His Apostle by God; yet God is aware of everything and is wise."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty, and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune. For them will be the adverse change, as God hears all and knows everything."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day, and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet. This is certainly a means of achieving nearness (to God), and God will admit them to His mercy, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way. For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever; and that is happiness supreme."/>
		<aya index="101" text="Some of the Arabs of the desert around you are hypocrites, and some of the people of Madina are stubborn in hypocrisy. You are not aware of them; We know them, and will punish them twice, and they will be sent to a harrowing doom."/>
		<aya index="102" text="But there are others who admit their sins of mixing good deeds with evil. It may be that God will accept their repentance, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Accept the offerings they make from their wealth in order to cleanse and purify them for progress, and invoke blessings upon them. Your blessings will surely bring them peace, for God hears all and knows everything."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Do they not know that God accepts the repentance of His creatures and receives what they offer in charity, and that He is forgiving and kind?"/>
		<aya index="105" text="Say to them: &quot;Act. God will see your conduct, and so will His Apostle and the faithful; for you will in the end go back to Him, who knows the unknown and the known, who will tell you of what you were doing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="106" text="There are still some others whose affairs await the dispensation of God. He may punish or pardon them, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="107" text="There are those who built a mosque on opposition and disbelief, and to cause rifts among the faithful, and to serve as an outpost for those who have warred against God and His Apostle before this. Yet they will surely swear: &quot;We had only meant well.&quot; But God is witness that they are liars."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Never set foot in that place. Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it. There you will find men who wish to be purified; and God loves those who are pure."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Is the man who lays the foundations of his sanctum on his allegiance to God and the wish to seek His favour, better, or he who lays the foundations of his building on the edge of a bank eroded by water, which will collapse with him into the fire of Hell? But God does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust."/>
		<aya index="110" text="The edifice they have built will always fill their minds with perturbation (which will not cease) till their hearts are rent to pieces, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="111" text="God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed. This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme."/>
		<aya index="112" text="To those who repent and pay homage, give praise and are devout, who kneel in prayer and bow in supplication, who enjoin good deeds and prohibit the bad, and keep to the limits set by God, announce the news of rejoicing to the faithful."/>
		<aya index="113" text="It is not worthy of the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who are idolaters, even though they may be their relatives, after they have come to know that they are destined for Hell."/>
		<aya index="114" text="As for Abraham's prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind."/>
		<aya index="115" text="God never leads men astray after guiding them, until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid, for God indeed knows each and everything."/>
		<aya index="116" text="Verily God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He alone is the giver of life and death; and none do you have besides God as friend and helper."/>
		<aya index="117" text="God was kind to the Prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress. When a section of them were about to lose courage He turned to them in His mercy, for He is compassionate and kind."/>
		<aya index="118" text="He has relented towards the three also (who had refused to go to the battle of the Ditch) whose case was left undecided, and even the earth with all its expanse had become narrow for them, and their lives were confined, and they came to realise there was no refuge for them except in God. So He softened towards them that they may repent; for God surely accepts repentance and is merciful."/>
		<aya index="119" text="O believers, do not stray from the path of God, and be with those who are truthful."/>
		<aya index="120" text="It was not worthy of the people of Madina, and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon the Prophet of God, and to care more for themselves than for him; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God, and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers, and no harm they receive from the enemy, but is put down as a good deed in their favour. Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste."/>
		<aya index="121" text="There is not a sum, large or small, that they spend, not a piece of land that they traverse (in the service of God) which is not put down in their favour, so that God could reward them for what they had done."/>
		<aya index="122" text="It is not possible for all believers to go out (to fight). So a part of each section (of the population) should go (to fight) in order that the others may acquire understanding of law and divinity, and warn their companions on return so that they may take heed for themselves."/>

		<aya index="124" text="When a Surah is revealed some of them remark: &quot;Whose faith among you has it increased?&quot; It does increase the faith of those who believe, and they rejoice."/>

		<aya index="4" text="To Him will you all return: God's promise is true. It is He who originates creation, then will revert it, so that He may reward those who believe and do good things in all justice. But those who deny the truth will receive boiling water to drink and grievous punishment, for they disbelieved."/>
		<aya index="5" text="It is He who gave the sun its radiance, the moon its lustre, and appointed its stations so that you may compute years and numbers. God did not create them but with deliberation. He distinctly explains His signs for those who can understand."/>
		<aya index="6" text="In the alternation of night and day, and all that He has created in the heavens and the earth, are certainly signs for people who fear God."/>
		<aya index="7" text="As for those who do not hope to meet Us (after death), and are content with the life of this world, who are oblivious of Our signs,"/>

		<aya index="11" text="If God were to hasten the evil, as men try to hasten the good, their term would come to end. So We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander perplexed in transgression."/>
		<aya index="12" text="When man is afflicted with adversity he calls to Us, whether lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We take away his troubles, he moves away, as though he had never called to Us in affliction. In the same way, attractive have been made their deeds to the prodigals."/>
		<aya index="13" text="How many generations did We lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust. Their apostles had brought clear proofs to them, yet they never believed. So We punished the sinful people."/>
		<aya index="14" text="Then We appointed you leaders in the land after them to see how you behaved."/>
		<aya index="15" text="When Our clear messages are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us, say: &quot;Bring a different Qur'an, or make amendments to this one.&quot; Say: &quot;It is not for me to change it of my will. I follow (only) what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an awful Day.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="Say: &quot;Had God pleased I would never have recited it to you, nor would He have given you comprehension of it. (Remember that I am one of you) and have lived a whole life with you before (its revelation). Even then you do not understand.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="19" text="Men were once a community of one faith; but they differed (and followed different ways). Had it not been for the word proclaimed by your Lord before, their differences would have been resolved."/>

		<aya index="21" text="When We let them taste Our mercy after affliction, they contrive against Our signs. Say: &quot;God is swifter at contriving,&quot; for Our angels record everything you plan."/>
		<aya index="22" text="It is He who enables you to travel over land and sea. When you sail in ships in a favourable breeze, you rejoice. But when a gale begins to blow and the waves dash against them from every side they realise that they have been caught in it, (and) they call on God in all faith: &quot;If You save us from this we shall ever be grateful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="But when He rescues them, they commit excesses in the land unjustly again. Your rebellion, O people, shall recoil back on your own selves. The joys of the world (are only ephemeral): You have to come back to Us in the end. We shall then inform you what you were doing."/>
		<aya index="24" text="The life of the world is like the rain that waters the crops of the earth which are used as food by men and cattle. But when the earth is embellished and adorned with gold, and its tillers begin to feel that (the crops) are under control, Our command descends suddenly at night or in the day, and We mow them down as though there was nothing there yesterday. This is how We distinctly explain Our signs to those who think."/>

They are the people of Hell, where they will abide for ever,"/>
		<aya index="28" text="The day We shall gather them all together We shall say to the idolaters: &quot;Take your stand with the compeers you worshipped as the equals of God.&quot; We shall then create a rift between them, and the compeers will say: &quot;You did not worship us;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="For God is sufficient as witness between us and you we were not aware of your worship.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Then each will see what he had done in the past; and they will turn to God, their true Lord, and all the lies they had fabricated will be of no avail to them."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Ask them: &quot;Who gives you food and sustenance from the skies and the earth? Or, who is the lord of ear and eye? And who brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living? And who directs all affairs?&quot; They will say: &quot;God.&quot; So tell them: &quot;Why do you not fear Him?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Such then is God, your true Lord; and when truth is gone what is left but error? So why do you turn away?"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Thus the word of your Lord about those who disobey comes true, that they do not believe."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Ask them: &quot;Is there among the partners (you ascribe to God) one who first originates then reverts it? Say: &quot;It is God alone who first creates and then reverts it. So where do you stray?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Ask: &quot;Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth?&quot; Say: &quot;It is God who shows the way to truth.&quot; Then who is more worthy of being followed -- He who guides to the truth, or he who cannot find the path until shown the way? What has happened to you that you judge in such a wise?"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Many of them follow nothing but illusion; yet illusion cannot replace the reality. God verily knows what they do."/>
		<aya index="37" text="This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God. It confirms what has been revealed before, and is an exposition of (Heaven's) law. Without any doubt it's from the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="38" text="Do they say (of the Prophet) that: &quot;He has composed it?&quot; Say to them: &quot;Bring a Surah like this, and call anyone apart from God you can (to help you), if what you say is true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="In fact, they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge, whose explanation has not reached them yet. So had those who have gone before them denied; but look at the fate of the unjust"/>

		<aya index="45" text="The day He will gather them together it will appear to them that they had lived (in the world) but an hour of a day to make each other's acquaintance. Verily those who deny the meeting with God will be lost, and not find the way."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Whether We show you some of the promise (of punishment in wait) for them, or take you to Ourself, their returning is to Us in the end; and God is a witness to all they do."/>
		<aya index="47" text="For every people there is an apostle; and when their apostle is come the matter is decided between them equitably, and no one is wronged."/>

		<aya index="54" text="Even if every soul that has sinned possessed whatever is on the earth, it would surely offer it to ransom itself, and feel repentant on seeing the punishment. Yet the sentence would be passed with justice, and not one will be wronged."/>
		<aya index="55" text="For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. Remember, the promise of God is true. But most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="56" text="He is the giver of life and death, and to Him you will return."/>
		<aya index="57" text="O men, a warning has come to you from your Lord, a remedy for the (doubts) of the heart, and a guidance and grace for those who believe."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Say: &quot;It is the blessing and mercy of God; so rejoice in it. It is better than all that you amass.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="Say: &quot;Have you thought of what God has sent you for food, of which you have labelled some as lawful and some forbidden?&quot; And ask: &quot;Has God commanded this, or you are imputing lies to God?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="What do those who invent lies of God think about the Day of Reckoning? (Will they escape the judgement?) In fact God is gracious to men; but most of them are not grateful."/>
		<aya index="61" text="There is no state you are in, whether reading from the Qur'an, or doing something else, but We are watching you as you are engaged in it. There is not the weight of an atom on the earth and in the heavens that is hidden from your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or greater than this but is recorded in the perspicuous Book."/>

		<aya index="63" text="Those who believe and obey God,"/>
		<aya index="64" text="For them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come. There is no changing the words of God. That will be the great triumph."/>
		<aya index="65" text="You should not be grieved by what they say. All glory is wholly for God: He is the one who hears and knows everything."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Remember, whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. Those who call on others they associate with God, follow nothing but conjecture, and only guess."/>
		<aya index="67" text="It is He who made the night for you to rest, and made the day enlightening. Indeed there are signs in this for those who listen."/>
		<aya index="68" text="They say: &quot;God has begotten a son.&quot; Immaculate is He and self-sufficient.&quot; Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. You have no proof for this (assertion): Why do you say things of God you do not know?"/>

		<aya index="70" text="Let them profit by the world (while they may): In the end they will come back to Us. Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for having denied (the truth)."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Recount to them the story of Noah when he said to his people: &quot;O people, if you find my staying with you and warning through God's signs, unbearable to you, know that I have reposed my trust in God. So plan your move, and call your associates, and make certain of your plan; then do whatever you intend against me, allowing me no respite."/>
		<aya index="72" text="If you turn away from me (remember) I do not ask any recompense from you. My reward is with God; I have been commanded to be one of those who submit to Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="Even then they denied him; so We saved him and those with him, in the ark, and established them in the land, and drowned those who denied Our signs. So think of the fate of those who were warned (and took no heed)."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Afterwards We sent many messengers who brought clear proofs to their peoples. But they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied. That is how We seal the hearts of the iniquitous."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles; but they behaved arrogantly, for they were a people full of guilt."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Thus, when the truth had come to them from Us, they said: &quot;Surely this is nothing but pure magic.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="&quot;You say this of the truth,&quot; said Moses, &quot;after it has come to you. Is this magic? But sorcerers do not ever prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="&quot;Have you come,&quot; said they, &quot;to turn us back from what we found our ancestors doing, so that the two of you may attain supremacy in the land? We shall not believe in what you say."/>
		<aya index="79" text="&quot;Bring the cleverest magicians to me,&quot; said the Pharaoh."/>
		<aya index="80" text="So when the magicians arrived, Moses said to them: &quot;Cast whatever (spell) you have to cast.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="When they had cast (their spell) Moses said: &quot;What you have cast is only a charm which God will surely nullify. God does not verily render the deeds of evil-doers righteous."/>
		<aya index="82" text="God vindicates the truth by His commands, however the sinners may dislike it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="But none of them put faith in Moses except some youths among his people who were nonetheless afraid lest the Pharaoh and his nobles should persecute them; for the Pharaoh was mighty in the land, and guilty of excesses."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Moses said: &quot;O my people, if you do believe in God place your trust in Him if you are obedient.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="85" text="They answered: &quot;We have placed our trust in God. O Lord, do not make us a target of oppression for these tyrannical people,"/>
		<aya index="86" text="And deliver us by Your grace from a people who do not believe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="We commanded Moses and his brother: &quot;Build homes for your people in Egypt, and make your houses places of worship, perform your acts of prayer and give happy tidings to those who believe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And Moses said: &quot;O Lord, have You bestowed on the Pharaoh and his nobles pomp and plenty in the life of this world that they might mislead people from Your path? Destroy their possessions, O Lord, and harden their hearts that they may not believe until they face the painful punishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="Said (the Lord): &quot;Your prayer is answered. Therefore persist and do not follow the path of those who are ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="And We brought the people of Israel across the sea, but the Pharaoh and his army pursued them wickedly and maliciously till he was on the point of drowning, and he said: &quot;I believe that there is no god but He in whom the people of Israel believe, and I submit to Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="&quot;Yes, now&quot; (was the answer), &quot;though before this you were disobedient and rebellious."/>
		<aya index="92" text="We shall preserve your body today that you may be a lesson for those who come after you; as many a man is heedless of Our signs.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="93" text="We gave the people of Israel a settled abode, and bestowed good things on them to eat and use. So they did not differ until they came to have knowledge. Your Lord will assuredly settle their differences on the Day of Resurrection."/>
		<aya index="94" text="If you are in doubt of what We have sent down to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book (for a long time) before you. The truth has indeed come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,"/>
		<aya index="95" text="And do not be one of those who deny the signs of God, or you will be among the losers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Verily those against whom the word of your Lord is pronounced will never believe,"/>
		<aya index="97" text="Even though all the signs came to them, not till they face the grievous punishment."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Why has there been no habitation that believed and profited by their faith, except the people of Jonah? When they came to believe, We removed from them the affliction of shame in the world, and made them prosperous for a time."/>
		<aya index="99" text="If your Lord had willed, all the people on the earth would have come to believe, one and all."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Are you going to compel the people to believe except by God's dispensation? He puts doubt in (the minds of) those who do not think."/>

		<aya index="102" text="Can they expect anything but what the people before them had known? Say: &quot;Then wait. I am waiting with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Thus do We deliver our apostles and those who believe. As a matter of duty We save the believers."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Say: &quot;O men, if you have doubt about my faith, then (know) I do not worship those you worship apart from God, but I worship God who makes you die; and I am commanded to be a believer,"/>
		<aya index="105" text="And to set my face toward the way, as one upright, and not be one of those who associate others with God."/>
		<aya index="106" text="And not to invoke any other than God, who can neither help nor hurt me; for if I do, I would surely be unjust."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Should God bring you harm there is none but He who could deliver you from it, and if He wish you good there is none who could take away His blessings: He showers them on those of His creatures as He please, and He is forgiving and kind.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="40" text="When Our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source, We said: &quot;Take into (the ark) a pair of every species, and members of your family other than those against whom the sentence has been passed already, and those who come to believe.&quot; But only a few believed in him."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And (Noah) said: &quot;Embark. In the name of God be its course and mooring. My Lord is surely forgiving and kind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="It sailed on waves like mountains (high), and Noah called to his son who was separated from him: &quot;Embark with us, O my son, and be not one of those who do not believe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="&quot;I shall go up a mountain,&quot; he said, &quot;which will keep me from the water.&quot; &quot;There is no getting away,&quot; said Noah, &quot;from the decree of God today, except for those on whom be His mercy.&quot; And a wave came between them, and he was among those who were drowned."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Then it was said: &quot;O earth, swallow back your water; and, O sky, desist.&quot; And the water subsided, and the decree was accomplished. The ark came to rest on Judi (Mount Ararat), and it was said: &quot;Away with the cursed people!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Noah called on his Lord and said: &quot;O Lord, my son is surely a member of my family, and verily Your promise is true, as You are the most just of all judges.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="46" text="&quot;O Noah&quot;, He answered, &quot;truly he is not of your family. He is surely the outcome of an unrighteous act. So ask Me not of what you do not know. I warn you not to be one of the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="&quot;Preserve me, O Lord,&quot; said (Noah), &quot;from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among those who perish.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="(And the Lord) said: &quot;O Noah, disembark with peace and safety from Us and blessings on you and the people with you. As for some (of them), We shall bestow advantages for a time, then send a grievous punishment on them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="This is news of the Unknown We reveal to you, which neither you nor your people knew before. So endure with patience. The future is for those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path."/>
		<aya index="50" text="We sent to the people of 'Ad their brother Hud, who said: &quot;O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. (As for the idols,) you are only inventing lies."/>
		<aya index="51" text="O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me. Will you not, therefore, understand?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="O my people, beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. He will send down rain in torrents for you from the shies, and give you added strength. So do not turn away from Him as sinners.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="They said: &quot;O Hud, you have come to us with no proofs. We shall not abandon our gods because you say so, nor believe in you."/>
		<aya index="54" text="All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil.&quot; He replied:&quot; I call God to witness, and you be witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (in your affairs)"/>
		<aya index="55" text="Apart from Him. Contrive against me as much as you like, and give me no respite."/>
		<aya index="56" text="I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him. Verily the way of my Lord is straight."/>
		<aya index="57" text="If you turn away, then (remember) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will put other people in your place, and you will not be able to prevail against Him. Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="58" text="So, when Our command was issued We rescued Hud by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, and saved them from a dreadful doom."/>
		<aya index="59" text="These were the people of 'Ad who denied the word of their Lord and rebelled against His apostles, and followed the bidding of every perverse tyrant."/>
		<aya index="60" text="So they were accursed in the world, and they will be damned on the Day of Doom. Beware! The 'Ad turned away from their Lord."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Be warned! Accursed are the people of 'Ad who were Hud's. To Thamud We Sent their brother Saleh. &quot;O my people,&quot; he said, &quot;worship God; you have no other god but He. It is He who raised you from the earth and settled you upon it. So beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is near and answers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="They said: &quot;O Saleh, we had placed our hopes in you, but you forbid us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped, and we are suspicious of what you are calling us to.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He said: &quot;O my people, have you considered that if my Lord has clearly shown me the way, and I have His blessings too, who will save me then from God if I disobey? You will only add to my ruin."/>
		<aya index="64" text="O my people, this she-camel of God is a token for you. So leave her alone to graze on God's earth, and do not molest her, otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="But they hamstrung her. Then (Saleh) said: &quot;You have but three days to enjoy life in your homes. Infallible is this promise."/>
		<aya index="66" text="So, when Our command (of punishment) came We delivered Saleh by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, from the disgrace of that day. Verily your Lord is mighty and powerful."/>
		<aya index="67" text="The sinners were seized by a blast from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning,"/>
		<aya index="68" text="As though they had never lived there at all. Beware! The people of Thamud turned away from their Lord. Beware! Accursed are the people of Thamud."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Our angels came to Abraham with good news, and said: &quot;Peace on you. &quot;Peace on you too,&quot; said Abraham, and hastened to bring a roasted calf."/>
		<aya index="70" text="When they did not stretch their hands towards it he became suspicious and afraid of them. They said: &quot;Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="His wife who stood near, laughed as We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac of Jacob."/>
		<aya index="72" text="She said: &quot;Woe betide me! Will I give birth when I am old and this my husband be aged? This is indeed surprising!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="&quot;Why are you surprised at the command of God? God's mercy and blessings be upon you, O members of this household,&quot; they said. &quot;Verily He is worthy of praise and glory.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="When Abraham's fear was dispelled, and the good news had come to him, he pleaded for the people of Lot with Us."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Abraham was kind, compassionate, and penitent."/>
		<aya index="76" text="&quot;Desist from pleading, O Abraham,&quot; (they said). &quot;Your Lord's command has verily been issued, and a punishment that cannot be averted is bound to fall on them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="So when Our angels came to Lot, he grieved for them, and felt powerless to help them, and said: &quot;This is a day of sorrow."/>
		<aya index="78" text="His people came excited to him. They were addicted to sin already. Said (Lot): &quot;O my people, these daughters of mine are cleaner (and lawful) for you. Have fear of God, and do not shame me before my guests. Is there no man of discernment among you?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="They said: &quot;You know we have no need for your daughters, and know well what we want.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="&quot;I wish I had the power to resist you,&quot; said (Lot), &quot;or powerful support.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="(The angels) said: &quot;O Lot, we have verily been sent by your Lord. They will never be able to harm you. So, leave late at night with your family, and none of you should turn back to look; but your wife will suffer (the fate) they are going to suffer. Their hour of doom is in the morning: Is not the morning nigh?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="82" text="So when the decreed moment arrived, We turned the habitations upside down, and rained upon them stones of hardened lava in quick succession,"/>
		<aya index="83" text="Impressed with (the signs) of your Lord. And such (punishment) is not far for the (other) transgressers."/>
		<aya index="84" text="We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib. He said: &quot;O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. So do not give in short measure nor underweigh. I see you are prosperous, but I fear the doom of an overwhelming Day for you."/>
		<aya index="85" text="So, O my people, weigh and measure with justness, and do not withhold things due to men, and do not spread corruption in the land, despoiling it."/>
		<aya index="86" text="That which is left to you by God is better, if you are true believers; yet I am not a warden over you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: &quot;O Shu'aib, does your piety teach that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped, or desist from doing what we like with our goods? How gracious a man of discernment you are indeed!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="He said: &quot;O my people, think. I have a clear sign from my Lord, who has also given me a goodly provision, and I do not wish for myself what I forbid you: I only wish to reform you as best I can. My success is from God alone. In Him I have placed my trust, and to Him I turn."/>
		<aya index="89" text="&quot;O my people (I fear) lest your opposition to me should bring you the like of what befell the people of Noah or Hud or Saleh; and the people of Lot are not distant from you."/>
		<aya index="90" text="&quot;Beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him. Indeed my Lord is compassionate and loving.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: &quot;O Shu'aib, much of what you say is meaningless to us, and then (for sure) you are powerless among us. But for your clan we would have stoned you to death. You have no power over us."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said: &quot;My clan seems mightier to you than God whom you neglect and push behind your backs. Surely what you do is within the power of my Lord."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Do on your part what you can, O people, I will do what I will. You will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who is the liar. So watch; I am watching with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when Our word came to pass, We rescued Shu'aib and those who believed, with him, by Our grace, but those who were wicked were seized by a punishment from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning."/>
		<aya index="95" text="As though they had not dwelt there at all. Beware! Condemmed were the people of Midian as those of Thamud had been before them!"/>
		<aya index="96" text="We sent Moses with Our signs and full authority"/>
		<aya index="97" text="To the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they followed the bidding of Pharaoh, though the bidding of Pharaoh was unrightful."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He shall be at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and drive them into Hell like cattle driven to water -- what an evil watering-place to reach!"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Damned will they be in this world, and on the Day of Doom how evil the gift that they will receive!"/>
		<aya index="100" text="These are a few accounts of settlements that We narrate to you. Some still survive, and some have been mowed down."/>
		<aya index="101" text="We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. When your Lord's chastisement descended upon them, their gods, on whom they called apart from God, were not of the least avail, and all they did was only to add to their destruction."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness. Surely His hold is grievous and terrible."/>
		<aya index="103" text="In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter, the day when mankind will be assembled together, which will be a day when all things would become evident."/>
		<aya index="104" text="We are deferring it only for a time ordained."/>
		<aya index="105" text="The day it comes no soul will dare say a word but by His leave; and some will be wretched, some will be blessed."/>
		<aya index="106" text="And those who are doomed, will be in Hell: For them will be sighing and sobbing,"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure, unless your Lord will otherwise. Verily your Lord does as He wills."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Those who are blessed will be in Paradise, where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth survive, unless your Lord wills otherwise: This will be a gift uninterrupted."/>
		<aya index="109" text="So, you should not entertain any doubt about those whom they worship: They only worship what their fathers had worshipped before them. We shall verily give them their meed without diminution."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Verily We gave to Moses the Book, but there was disagreement about it. Had the decree of your Lord (delaying it) not been issued the matter would have been settled between them. They are still suspicious of it and in doubt."/>
		<aya index="111" text="Surely your Lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds. He is certainly aware of all they do."/>
		<aya index="112" text="So, you and those who turned to God with you, should walk along the straight path as you have been commanded, and do not transgress, for He verily sees whatsoever you do."/>
		<aya index="113" text="Do not lean towards the wicked, or you will be caught in the flames of Hell, and have none to befriend you other than God, nor will you be given help."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Stand up for the service of prayer at the two ends of day and the first watch of night. Remember that good deeds nullify the bad. This is a reminder for those who are observant."/>
		<aya index="115" text="Be steadfast, for verily God does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste."/>
		<aya index="116" text="If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you, who could preserve men from doing evil in the world, other than the few We saved from among them. Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute, and became sinners."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Your Lord would not surely destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous."/>
		<aya index="118" text="But if your Lord had pleased He could have made all human beings into one community of belief. But they would still have differed from one another,"/>
		<aya index="119" text="Except those on whom your Lord had mercy for which He has created them. But fulfilled shall be the word of your Lord. &quot;I will fill up Hell with jinns and men.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="120" text="The histories of apostles that We relate to you are (meant) to strengthen your heart. Through them has the truth come to you, and guidance, and reminder to those who believe."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Say to the infidels. &quot;Act as best you can, we are acting too;"/>
		<aya index="122" text="And wait (for what is to come), we are also waiting (to see).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="123" text="To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and all things will go back to Him. So worship Him and put your trust in Him; your Lord is not heedless of what you do."/>

		<aya index="8" text="&quot;Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we,&quot; (said his half brothers) &quot;even though we are a well-knit band. Our father is surely in the wrong."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Let us kill Joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father's exclusive affection; then play innocent.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="10" text="One of them said: &quot;If you must do so, then do not kill Joseph, but throw him into an unused well. Some passing caravan may rescue him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="11" text="(Then going to their father) they said: &quot;O father, why don't you trust us with Joseph? We are in fact his well-wishers."/>

		<aya index="72" text="&quot;We cannot find the master's goblet. Whoever comes up with it will be given a camel-load of grain; I vouch for it.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="76" text="So he searched their saddle-bags before his brother's, then produced the cup from his brother's bag. That is how We planned an excuse for Joseph, for under the law of the king he could not detain his brother unless God so willed. We raise the status of whom We please. Over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing."/>
		<aya index="77" text="Said the brothers: &quot;If he has stolen (no wonder), his brother had stolen before.&quot; But Joseph kept this secret and did not disclose it to them, and said (to himself): &quot;You are worse in the degree of evil, for God knows better of what you allege.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="88" text="When they returned to him, they said (to Joseph): &quot;O Minister, calamity has befallen us and our people. We have brought but a meagre sum, but give us full measure as alms bestowed. God surely rewards those who give alms.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text=", He said: &quot;Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They said: &quot;Surely you are not Joseph!&quot; &quot;I am Joseph,&quot; he said, &quot;and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us; for God does not verily deprive those who fear Him and are patient of the recompense of those who are good.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: &quot;By God, God has favoured you above us, for we have indeed been sinners.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="&quot;There is no blame on you today,&quot; he said, &quot;May God forgive you. He is the most merciful of all."/>

		<aya index="71" text="God has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence. But those who have been favoured with more do not give of their means to their dependents so that they may become equal with them. Do they then deny God's beneficence?"/>

		<aya index="74" text="So do not invent similitudes for God. Indeed God knows, and you do not know."/>
		<aya index="75" text="God presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything, and another on whom We have bestowed a handsome fortune, who spends from it in private and in public: Can they be equal? Praised be God! But most men do not understand."/>
		<aya index="76" text="God presents another example of two men, one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent he returns without any good (result). Could he be equal to one who enjoins what is just, and follows the right path?"/>
		<aya index="77" text="To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and the Hour of Doom is a matter of the winking of an eye, even less, for God has certainly power over all things."/>

		<aya index="79" text="Do you not see the birds held high between the heavens and the earth? Nothing holds them (aloft) but God. There are verily signs in this for those who believe."/>
		<aya index="80" text="God has given you homes to live in, and tents (made) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time."/>
		<aya index="81" text="God has given you of things created, shade, and places of shelter in the mountains, and clothes for protection against the heat, and coats (of mail) for defence during war. He thus bestows His favours on you so that you may be grateful to Him."/>

		<aya index="85" text="And when the wicked shall face the torment it will not be decreased, nor will they be reprieved."/>
		<aya index="86" text="When the idolaters see their partners they will call out: &quot;O our Lord, these are the partners we invoked instead of You;&quot; but they will retort: &quot;You are liars.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They will offer submission to God that Day, and the lies they fabricated will not be of the least avail."/>
		<aya index="88" text="For those who deny the truth and obstruct (others) from the way of God, We shall add torment to torment as they were perpetrating corruption."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them, and make you a witness over them, for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything, and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Verily God has enjoined justice, the doing of good, and the giving of gifts to your relatives; and forbidden indecency, impropriety and oppression. He warns you so that you may remember."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do."/>
		<aya index="92" text="And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread. Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you. God surely tries you in this way: He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about."/>
		<aya index="93" text="If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief; but He leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whosoever He please. But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do."/>
		<aya index="94" text="So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another, lest your foot should slip after having found its hold, and you taste of evil for having hindered (others) from the way of God, and suffer a grievous punishment."/>
		<aya index="95" text="And do not trade God's covenant for a paltry price. Remember, what is with God is better for you, if only you knew!"/>
		<aya index="96" text="For what you possess will pass, but what is with God will abide. We shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds."/>
		<aya index="97" text="We shall invest whosoever works for good, whether man or woman, with a pleasant life, and reward them in accordance with the best of what they have done."/>
		<aya index="98" text="So, when you recite the Qur'an seek refuge in God from Satan the execrable."/>

		<aya index="103" text="Yet We know what they say: &quot;It is only a man who instructs him.&quot; The speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear Arabic."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Those who do not believe in the words of God are verily not guided by God. For them is severe punishment."/>
		<aya index="105" text="They alone invent lies who do not believe in the words of God, and they are liars."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Whosoever denies having once believed -- unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith -- and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great,"/>
		<aya index="107" text="For they loved the life of this world more than the life to come; and God does not guide those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="108" text="They are the ones whose hearts and ears and eyes have been sealed by God; and these are the heedless."/>
		<aya index="109" text="They will surely be losers in the life to come,"/>
		<aya index="110" text="But (to) those who were victimised and left their homes and then fought and endured patiently, your Lord will surely be forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="111" text="On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be recompensed for what it had done, no one will be wronged."/>
		<aya index="112" text="God presents the example of a town which enjoyed peace and security, its provisions coming from everywhere in abundance, but it denied the favours of God; so God acquainted it with intimate hunger and fear (as punishment) for what they had done."/>
		<aya index="113" text="An apostle came to them who was one of them, but they called him a liar. Then they were seized by torment for they were sinners."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Eat the good and lawful of things that God has given you, and be grateful for the bounty of God, if you really worship Him."/>
		<aya index="115" text="He has forbidden carrion and blood and the flesh of the swine, and what has been killed in the name of any other but God; but if one is driven by necessity (to eat it) without craving or reverting to it, then God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="116" text="Do not utter the lies your tongues make up: &quot;This is lawful, and this is forbidden,&quot; in order to impute lies to God; for they who impute lies to God will not find fulfilment."/>
		<aya index="117" text="For them there is some enjoyment, but the punishment is painful."/>
		<aya index="118" text="We have already told you what We have forbidden the Jews. We did not wrong them, they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="119" text="To those who do wrong out of ignorance, then repent and correct themselves, your Lord is indeed forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Abraham was certainly a model of faith, obedient to God and upright, and not one of idolaters,"/>

		<aya index="59" text="Nothing could stop Us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies. We sent to Thamud the she-camel as a token to make it clear to them, but they treated her cruelly; and We send signs only to deter."/>
		<aya index="60" text="When We said to you: &quot;Verily your Lord circumscribes mankind,&quot; and showed you the vision and the accursed tree of the Qur'an, it was as a bone of contention for men. Thus do We (instil) fear in them; but they only transgress the more."/>

		<aya index="69" text="Or you feel so secure that He will not send you back (to sea) again or send a gravel-hurtling storm against you, and drown you for your ingratitude? Then you will not find any avenger against Us."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Indeed We have honoured the children of Adam, and carried them over land and sea, provided them with good things for their sustenance, and exalted them over many of Our creatures."/>

		<aya index="94" text="Nothing prevented men from believing when guidance came to them, other than (what) they said: &quot;Has God sent (only) a man as messenger?&quot;"/>

		<aya index="97" text="He is guided whom God guides. As for him He allows to go astray, you will not find a protector other than Him. We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection in their own image, blind and dumb and deaf: Their habitation will be Hell. Every time (its fire) subsides We will intensify its flame."/>
		<aya index="98" text="This will be their retribution for having denied Our signs and said: &quot;Once we are turned to bones and bits, can we be raised as a new creation?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Do they not perceive that God, who created the heavens and the earth, has the power to create the like of them? There is no doubt that. He has fixed a term for them. Even then the wicked disdain everything but unbelief."/>

		<aya index="101" text="We gave Moses nine clear signs; so ask the children of Israel. When (Moses) came to them the Pharaoh said: &quot;I think, O Moses, you have been deluded.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="107" text="Say: &quot;Believe in it or do not believe: Those who were given knowledge before it bow in adoration when it is read out to them,"/>
		<aya index="108" text="And say: &quot;Glory be to our Lord. The promise of our Lord has indeed been fulfilled.&quot;"/>

And yet you take him and his offspring as your friends instead of Me, even though they are your enemies. How sad a substitute for the evil-doers!"/>
		<aya index="51" text="I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray."/>

		<aya index="56" text="We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings, and to warn. But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth. They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past. Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright."/>
		<aya index="58" text="But your Lord is forgiving, full of benevolence. If He had pleased to punish them for their doings He would have punished them immediately. But a term is fixed for them from which they will find no escape."/>
		<aya index="59" text="As for these habitations, We destroyed them only when they transgressed; even so We had fixed a time for their annihilation."/>
		<aya index="60" text="When Moses said to his servant (Joshua): &quot;I will not give up till I reach the confluence of two oceans, or I will journey on and on.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea."/>
		<aya index="62" text="When they had gone past (the confluence), Moses said to his servant: &quot;Give me my breakfast. I am exhausted from this journey.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He said: &quot;You see, I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped. Only Satan made me forget to mention this; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Moses said: &quot;But that is exactly what we were seeking.&quot; So they retraced their steps."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Then they found one of Our votaries, whom We had blessed and given knowledge from Us."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said to him: &quot;May I attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He said: &quot;You will not be able to bear with me."/>
		<aya index="68" text="&quot;How can you bear that which is beyond your comprehension?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="&quot;You will find me patient if God wills,&quot; said Moses; &quot;and I will not disobey you in any thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="&quot;If you must follow me,&quot; he said, &quot;do not ask me any thing until I speak of it to you myself.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) &quot;You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="&quot;Did I not tell you,&quot; he replied, &quot;that you will not be able to bear with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="(Moses) said: &quot;Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="The two went on till they came to a boy, whom he killed. Moses exclaimed: &quot;You have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life. You have done a most abominable thing!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="He said: &quot;Did I not tell you you will not be able to bear with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Moses said: &quot;If I ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you. You have my apology.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="The two went on till they came upon some villagers, and asked the people for food, but they refused to entertain them. There they found a wall that was crumbling, which he repaired. Moses remarked: &quot;You could have demanded wages for it if you liked.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="&quot;This is the parting of our &quot;ways,&quot; he said. &quot;But I will now explain the things you could not bear:"/>
		<aya index="79" text="That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force."/>
		<aya index="80" text="As for the boy, his parents were believers, but we feared that he would harass them with defiance and disbelief."/>
		<aya index="81" text="We hoped their Lord would give them a substitute better than him in virtue and goodness."/>
		<aya index="82" text="As for that wall, it belonged to two orphan boys of the city, and their treasure was buried under it. Their father was an upright man. So your Lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure as a favour from their Lord. So, I did not do that of my own accord. This is the explanation of things you could not bear with patience.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="They ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnain."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Say: &quot;I will cite before you his commemoration.&quot; We gave him authority in the land and means of accomplishing every end."/>
		<aya index="85" text="So he followed a certain road"/>
		<aya index="86" text="Till he reached the point of the setting sun, and saw it set behind a muddy lake, and near it found a people. We said: &quot;O Dhu'l-Qarnain, you may either punish them or treat them with kindness.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="He said: &quot;I shall punish whosoever is wicked. He will then be sent back to his Lord who will inflict on him a terrible punishment."/>
		<aya index="88" text="But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He then followed (another) road"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Till he reached the point of the rising sun, and saw it rise over a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it."/>
		<aya index="91" text="It was so, for We were fully informed about him."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He then followed (another) road"/>
		<aya index="93" text="Till he reached a place between two mountains, and found this side of it a people who understood but little of what was spoken."/>
		<aya index="94" text="They said: 'O Dhu'l-Qarnain, Gog and Magog are oppressing the land. May we pay you some tribute so that you could build a rampart between us and them?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="He said: &quot;The ability my Lord has given me is better. So help me with your manual labour; I will build a wall between you and them."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Bring me ingots of iron,&quot; (which they did) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up. &quot;Blow your bellows,&quot; he said; (and they blew) until it was red hot. &quot;Bring me molten brass,&quot; he said, &quot;that I may pour over it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="Thus (Gog and Magog) could neither climb over it nor dig a hole through (the rampart)."/>
		<aya index="98" text="&quot;This is the benevolence of my Lord,&quot; he said; &quot;but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to a mound of dust; and the promise of my Lord is true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other, and the trumpet blast will be sounded, when We shall gather them all together."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Then We shall bring Hell right before the infidels"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Whose eyes were veiled against My warning, and they could not hear."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Say: &quot;Shall I tell you whose labour will be wasted?"/>
		<aya index="104" text="Theirs whose effort is misspent in pursuit of the pleasures of the world, even though they think they are doing good things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="105" text="They are those who reject the signs of their Lord, and the meeting with Him. So their good deeds will be fruitless, and on the Day of Judgement We shall not appoint any weighing for them."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Their requital will be Hell, because they disbelieved and mocked My signs and messengers."/>
		<aya index="107" text="But surely those who believe and do the right will have gardens of Paradise as gift,"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Where they will abide for ever, never wanting a change."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Say: &quot;If the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my Lord, the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words (and wonders) of my Lord come to end, even if we brought another like it for replenishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="110" text="Say: &quot;I am only a man like you, but it has been communicated to me that your Lord is one and single God, and that whosoever hopes to meet his Lord should do what is right, and not associate any one in the worship of his Lord.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="51" text="(The Pharaoh) said: &quot;And what about the former generations?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="(Moses) replied: &quot;Knowledge of that is with my Lord (recorded) in the Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation"/>
		<aya index="54" text="To eat and feed your cattle. Surely there are signs in these for those who are wise."/>
		<aya index="55" text="We created you from the earth and will revert you back to it; and raise you up from it a second time."/>
		<aya index="56" text="So We showed him all Our signs, but he denied them and refused,"/>
		<aya index="57" text="And said: &quot;Have you come to us, O Moses, to drive us out of our land with your witchery?"/>
		<aya index="58" text="We shall certainly meet you with like magic. So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground, which neither we nor you should fail to keep.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="Said (Moses): &quot;Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast, and let people assemble in broad daylight.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="After this the Pharaoh withdrew and settled his stratagem, then came back."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Moses said to them: &quot;Woe betide you. Do not fabricate a lie against God, or He will destroy you with some affliction. For he who fabricates lies is doomed to failure.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="So they discussed their strategy among themselves and conferred privately,"/>
		<aya index="63" text="(And) said: &quot;These two are surely magicians. They want to deprive you of your land with their magic, and eradicate your distinct way (of life)."/>
		<aya index="64" text="So prepare your strategy and come forward. He alone shall win today who is superior.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="They said: &quot;Either you cast (your spell), O Moses, or we shall cast it first.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said: &quot;No. You cast it first&quot; Then it seemed to Moses that by their magic their cords and rods were flying;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="And Moses felt afraid within himself."/>
		<aya index="68" text="We said to him: &quot;Fear not. You will certainly be victorious."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="The magicians, (seeing the miracle), fell down in prostration, saying: &quot;We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="(The Pharaoh) said: &quot;You have come to believe without my dispensation. Surely he is your chief who taught you magic. I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of date-palm trees. You will come to know whose punishment is harder and protracted.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They replied: &quot;We cannot choose you in the face of the clear testimony we have received, and over Him who created us. So do what you are determined to do. All that you would do will only be confined to our life on earth."/>
		<aya index="73" text="We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform, for God is nobler and abiding.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Surely for him who comes before his Lord a sinner shall be Hell, where he will neither die nor live."/>
		<aya index="75" text="But whoever comes before Him a believer having done good deeds, will be raised to higher stations --"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Gardens of Eden with rippling streams, where he will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who achieve integrity."/>
		<aya index="77" text="We commanded Moses: &quot;Journey by night with Our creatures, and strike a dry path for them through the sea. Do not fear being overtaken, nor have dread of any thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Then the Pharaoh followed them with his army, but the sea overpowered and engulfed them."/>
		<aya index="79" text="The Pharaoh had led his people astray, and did not rightly guide them."/>
		<aya index="80" text="O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down for you manna and quails,"/>
		<aya index="81" text="(And said): &quot;Eat of the good things We have given you for food, and do not exceed the bounds (of law) in this, or My wrath will surely fall upon you; and he who incurs My wrath will fall into the abyss."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Yet I am gracious to him who repents and believes, and does the right, and follows the straight path."/>
		<aya index="83" text="What made you hurry away, O Moses, from your people?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="He said: &quot;They are right behind me. I have hastened to You, O Lord, so that You may be pleased.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="85" text="He said: &quot;We have put your people on trial in your absence; and Sameri has led them astray.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. &quot;O my people,&quot; he said, &quot;did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: &quot;We did not break our promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people, which we threw (into the fire), and so did Sameri."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Then he produced the image of a calf which mooed like a cow. And they said: 'This is your god and the god of Moses (whom) he has neglected.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="Did they not see that it did not give them any answer, nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Aaron had indeed told them earlier: &quot;O my people, you are being only misled with this. Surely your Lord is Ar-Rahman. So follow me and obey my command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said &quot;So long as Moses does not come back we are not going to give it up, and we will remain devoted to it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="But (Moses) said: &quot;O Aaron, when you saw that they had gone astray, what hindered you"/>
		<aya index="93" text="From coming after me? Did you not disobey my command?&quot; (And Moses pulled him by the hair)."/>
		<aya index="94" text="&quot;O son of my mother,&quot; (Aaron cried), do not pull me by my beard or my hair! I was really afraid you may say that I had created a rift among the children of Israel, and did not pay heed to your command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="Moses asked: &quot;O Sameri, what was the matter?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="He said: &quot;I saw what they did not see. I picked up a handful of dust from the messenger's tracks and threw it in, for the idea seemed attractive to me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="(Moses) said: &quot;Go hence! All your life you are (cursed) to say: 'Do not touch me; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape. Look at your god to whom you are so attached: We shall verily burn it, and disperse its ashes into the sea."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Your god is only God. There is no other god but He. His knowledge extends over everything.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Thus do We narrate some account to you of what has gone before, and We have truly given you a Reminder of Our own."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the Day of Judgement,"/>
		<aya index="101" text="And will live for ever under it. How evil the burden they will carry on the Day of Doom!"/>
		<aya index="102" text="The day the trumpet blast is sounded We shall raise the sinners blind,"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Whispering to one another: &quot;You have tarried but ten days.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="104" text="We know well what they will say when the most upright among them will say: &quot;You did not tarry more than a day.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="105" text="They will ask you about the mountains. Tell them: &quot;My Lord will uproot them from the base,"/>
		<aya index="106" text="And turn them into a level plain,"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Over which you will see no curves or elevations."/>
		<aya index="108" text="That day they will follow the summoner from whom there will be no receding; and their voices will be hushed before Ar-Rahman, and you will not hear a sound but faint shuffling."/>
		<aya index="109" text="On that day no intercession will matter other than his whom Ar-Rahman grants permission and accepts."/>
		<aya index="110" text="He knows what is before them and hidden from them, but they cannot grasp it with their knowledge."/>
		<aya index="111" text="All heads will be bowed before the Living, the Eternal; and whosoever bears a load of iniquity will be full of despair."/>
		<aya index="112" text="But he who has done good things and believes, will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived."/>
		<aya index="113" text="That is why We have sent it down as an eloquent Qur'an, and explained in different ways the intimidations through it that they may haply take heed, or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: &quot;O Lord, give me greater knowledge.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="115" text="We had commanded Adam before, but he disregarded it: We found him lacking in resolution."/>
		<aya index="116" text="When We said to the angels: ''Bow before Adam,'' they all bowed but Iblis, who refused."/>
		<aya index="117" text="So We said; &quot;O Adam, he is truly your enemy and your wife's. Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there,"/>
		<aya index="119" text="Nor thirst nor exposure to the sun.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="120" text="But then Satan tempted him by saying: &quot;O Adam, should I show you the tree of immortality, and a kingdom that will never know any wane?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="121" text="And both ate of (its fruit), and their hidden parts were exposed to one another, and they patched the leaves of the garden (to hide them). Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went astray."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Then his Lord chose him and relented towards him, and showed him the way;"/>
		<aya index="123" text="(And) said: &quot;Go down hence together, one the enemy of the other. Then will guidance come to you from Me; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable."/>
		<aya index="124" text="But he who fails to heed My warning will have his means restricted; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="125" text="He will ask: &quot;O Lord, why have you raised me blind when I was able to see?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="126" text="(God) will say: &quot;Because Our signs came to you, but you disregarded them. So shall We disregard you this day.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And that is how We requite him who is extravagant and does not believe the signs of his Lord; and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and persistent."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Did they not learn from the many generations that We destroyed before them, whose habitations they now frequent? Verily there are signs in this for men of understanding."/>
		<aya index="129" text="If the decree (of respite) had not been pronounced by your Lord, (the inevitable judgement would have ensued); but a term is fixed (for everything)."/>
		<aya index="130" text="So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising and setting of the sun, and honour Him in the watches of the night, and then at the two ends of day, that you may find acceptance."/>
		<aya index="131" text="Do not covet what We have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them. The means your Lord has given you are better far and more enduring."/>
		<aya index="132" text="Enjoin on your people service to God, and be yourself constant in it. We do not ask you to provide: It is We who provide for you. The reward is for piety and fear of God."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Yet they say: &quot;Why does he not bring a sign from his Lord?&quot; Have not clear proofs come to them in what is contained in the earlier Books?"/>
		<aya index="134" text="If We had destroyed them by some calamity sooner than this, they would have surely said: &quot;O Lord, if You had sent to us a messenger we would have followed Your command before being humbled and disgraced.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say: &quot;Each one awaits the consequence; so you wait. You will come to know soon who are the men of the straight path and who have come to guidance."/>

		<aya index="61" text="&quot;Bring him before the people,&quot; they said, &quot;that they may bear witness.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="&quot;Did you do this to our gods, O Abraham?&quot; they enquired."/>
		<aya index="63" text="&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;It was done by that chief of theirs. Ask him in case they can speak.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then they thought and observed: &quot;Surely you are yourselves unjust.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="74" text="To Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and saved him from a people who acted villainously and were certainly wicked and disobedient."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Thus We admitted him to Our grace. He is surely one of the righteous."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Remember Noah when he called to Us before this. We heard him and saved him and those with him from great distress;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="And We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs as lies. They were a wicked people indeed, so We drowned them one and all."/>
		<aya index="78" text="(Remember) David and Solomon, when they pronounced judgement about the field which was eaten up at night by sheep belonging to certain people. We were witness to their judgement."/>
		<aya index="79" text="We made Solomon understand the case, and bestowed on each wisdom and knowledge, We subdued the al-jibal (mountains) with David to sing Our praises, and at-tair (birds). It is We who did it."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And We taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each other's violence. Will you not be grateful even then?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="We made tempestuous winds obedient to Solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding (with his ships) to the land We had blessed. We are cognisant of everything."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And many of the devils (We also made obedient to him) who dived for him, and did many other things; and We kept watch over them."/>
		<aya index="83" text="(Remember) Job when he called to his Lord: &quot;I am afflicted with distress, and You are the most compassionate of all.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="So We heard his cry and relieved him of the misery he was in. We restored his family to him, and along with them gave him others similar to them as a grace from Us and reminder for those who are obedient."/>
		<aya index="85" text="(Remember) Ishmael, Edris and Dhu'l-Kifl. They were men of fortitude,"/>
		<aya index="86" text="And they were admitted to Our grace. Verily they were among the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And (remember) Dhu'n-Noon (Jonah of the fish), when he went away in anger and imagined We will not test him (with distress). Then he called out from the darkness: &quot;There is no god other than You. All glory to You; surely I was a sinner."/>
		<aya index="88" text="We heard his cry, and saved him from the anguish. That is how We deliver those who believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="(Remember) Zachariah when he called to his Lord: &quot;Do not leave me alone (and childless), for you are the best of givers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="So We heard him and gave him John, and cured his wife (of barrenness). These were men who vied in good deeds with one another, and prayed to Us with love and awe, and were meek before Us."/>
		<aya index="91" text="(Remember) her who preserved her chastity, into whom We breathed a new life from Us, and made her and her son a token for mankind."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Verily this your order is one order, and I am your Lord; so worship Me."/>
		<aya index="93" text="But they split up the order among themselves; (yet) all of them have to come back to Me."/>
		<aya index="94" text="So he who does the right and is a believer, will not have his labour denied, for We are congnisant of it."/>
		<aya index="95" text="It is imperative that a habitation We have destroyed will not desist (from unbelief)"/>
		<aya index="96" text="Until when the way is opened up for Gog and Magog and they press from every elevated place,"/>
		<aya index="97" text="And the certain promise (of Doom) comes near. Then the eyes of unbelievers will be fixed in horror, (and they will cry:) &quot;Ah, woe betide, we were indeed heedless of this, and were oppressors and unjust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Verily you and those you worship other than God will be faggots for Hell; and come to it you will."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Had they really been gods they would not have entered it: They will all abide in it for ever."/>
		<aya index="100" text="There will only be groaning for them, and they will not hear any thing."/>

		<aya index="105" text="We had prescribed in the Book of Psalms after the reminder and admonition, that those of Our creatures who are good will in the end rule the earth."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Verily there is a message in this for people who are devout."/>
		<aya index="107" text="We have sent you as a benevolence to the creatures of the world."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Say: &quot;This is what has been revealed to me: 'Your God is one and only God.' So will you bow in homage to Him?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="109" text="If they turn away, tell them: &quot;I have warned you all alike. I do not know if what has been promised you is near or far away."/>

We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age. Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once.

That is why We have brought them under your subjugation so that you may be grateful."/>

		<aya index="58" text="Those who left their homes in the way of God, and then were killed or died, will surely be given a better provision by God, for God is surely the best of providers."/>
		<aya index="59" text="God will surely lead them to a place with which they will be gratified. Verily God is all-knowing and forbearing."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Whosoever retaliates to the extent of injury suffered by him, and is wronged again, will certainly be helped by God. Verily God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="61" text="That is so for God turns night into day and day into night, for God is all-hearing and all-seeing;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="That is so for God is the undeniable truth, and what they invoke apart from Him is false; yet God is all-high and supreme."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Do you not see how God sends down water from the sky and in the morning the earth turns green? Truly God is benign and well-informed."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. Surely God is all-sufficing, worthy of praise."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Do you not see God has harnessed all that is in the earth, to your service? And the boats ply in the ocean by His command. He holds the sky in position lest it should fall upon the earth save by His dispensation. Verily God is compassionate and kind to men."/>
		<aya index="66" text="It is He who gives you life, then makes you die; then He will bring you back to life again. Man is surely most ungrateful."/>
		<aya index="67" text="We have determined for each community a way of worship which they follow. So they should not contend with you in this matter; and you should go on calling them to your Lord. You are surely on the right path."/>
		<aya index="68" text="If they argue with you, tell them: &quot;God knows well what you are doing."/>
		<aya index="69" text="God will judge between you on the Day of Judgement in what you are at variance.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Do you not know that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? This is surely in accordance with the law. This is certainly how (the law of) God works inevitably."/>

		<aya index="72" text="When Our clear messages are read out to them you can see denial on the faces of unbelievers. They can hardly restrain themselves from attacking those who recite Our revelations. Tell them: &quot;Should I give you news of something worse than this?&quot; -- Hell, which God has promised the infidels. How evil a destination!"/>
		<aya index="73" text="O men, give ear to this parable: Those you worship other than God can never create as much as a fly, even if they get together to do so; and if the fly were to rob them of a thing they would not be able to snatch it away from it. How weak the seeker and how weak the sought!"/>
		<aya index="74" text="They do not esteem God with the right estimation. God is surely all-powerful and all-mighty."/>

		<aya index="78" text="Strive in the way of God with a service worthy of Him. He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham. He named you Muslim earlier, and in this (Qur'an), in order that the Prophet be witness over you, and you be witness over mankind. So be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and hold on firmly to God. He is your friend: How excellent a friend is He, how excellent a helper!"/>

But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health. That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave. Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God's forgiveness for them. Surely God is forgiving and kind."/>

		<aya index="2" text="These are the verses of the illuminating Book."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We narrate to you from the history of Moses and Pharaoh in all verity, for those who believe."/>
		<aya index="4" text="The Pharaoh had become high and mighty in the land, and divided the people into different classes, and impoverished one class, slaying its males and sparing its women, for he was indeed a tyrant."/>
		<aya index="5" text="We wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs,"/>
		<aya index="6" text="And establish them in the country; and to make the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes beware of what they feared from them."/>
		<aya index="7" text="So We conveyed to the mother of Moses: &quot;Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him an apostle.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then he was picked up by the family of Pharaoh (unaware) that he would become their enemy and a cause for regret. Surely the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes were habitual sinners."/>
		<aya index="9" text="The Pharaoh's wife said: &quot;He will be a comfort to me and to you. Do not kill him. He may well be of some advantage to us, or we may adopt him as a son.&quot; They were not aware (of what the future held in store)."/>
		<aya index="10" text="The mother of Moses was perturbed in the morning. Had We not strengthened her heart to remain a believer she had almost given him away."/>
		<aya index="11" text="She told his sister: &quot;Follow him.&quot; So she kept an eye on him from a distance, unbeknown to them."/>
		<aya index="12" text="We made (Moses) refuse a wet nurse. So his sister said: &quot;Should I tell you of a household that could bring him up for you and take care of him?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Thus We restored him to his mother that she may be tranquil and not grieve, and know that the promise of God is true, though most men do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When he had grown up to full maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We recompense the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="15" text="He came to the city when the people were in a care-free mood, and saw two men quarrelling, one belonging to his community, the other to his enemies. The man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies. Moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off. &quot;This is of Satan's doing,&quot; he said. &quot;He is certainly an enemy and a corrupter.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="&quot;O Lord,&quot; he prayed, &quot;I have done wrong, forgive me.&quot; And God forgave him. Verily He is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="17" text="(Moses) said: &quot;O Lord, as You have been gracious to me I will never aid the guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). &quot;You are indeed a meddlesome fellow,&quot; Moses said to him."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Then as he was about to lay hands on the one who was their common enemy, he cried out: &quot;O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="20" text="There came a man running from the other part of the city. &quot;O Moses,&quot; he said, &quot;the chiefs are deliberating to kill you. Go away from the city. I wish you well.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="So he left the city, fearful and hesitant, (and) prayed: &quot;O Lord, deliver me from these wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Then as he turned his face to Midian, he said: &quot;Maybe my Lord will show me the right way.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="And when he came to the waters of Midian he found a crowd of people watering (their flocks), and saw two maidens holding back (their cattle). He asked: &quot;What is the trouble with you?&quot; They said: &quot;We cannot water our flock till the shepherds have driven away theirs, and our father is a very old man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="So he watered (their flock), and moved into the shade and prayed: &quot;My Lord, I have need of whatever good you send me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then one of the (maidens) came to him walking bashfully, (and) said: &quot;My father invites you that he may repay you for having watered our flock.&quot; So, when (Moses) came to him and told him his story, he said: &quot;Have no fear. You have escaped from the wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Said one of the maidens: &quot;O father, employ him. Surely the best (man) to employ is one who is strong and honest.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="He said: &quot;I would like to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you agree to work for me on hire for eight years. And if you stay on for ten, it is up to you. I do not wish to impose any hardship on you. God willing you will find me a man of honour.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="(Moses) said: &quot;This is (agreed) between you and me. Whichever term I fulfil, no injustice will be done to me. God is witness to our agreement.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain. &quot;Wait here,&quot; he said to his family; &quot;I have seen a fire. I may haply bring some news from there, or an ember that you may warm yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="When he drew near, a voice called out to him from the tree on the blessed spot on the right side of the valley: &quot;O Moses, I am verily God, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Throw down your staff.&quot; When he saw it wriggling like a serpent, he turned about and fled without turning. &quot;O Moses, approach,&quot; (said the Voice), &quot;and have no fear. You will be safe."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Put your hand inside your shirt. It will come out white without a tarnish of blame; and do not be perturbed or afraid. These are two proofs from your Lord for the Pharaoh and his nobles. They are certainly a rebellious people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: &quot;O Lord, I have killed a man of theirs, and fear they would kill me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="(And) God said: &quot;We shall strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you power with Our signs and give you authority, so that they will not be able to harm you. Both of you and your followers will be victorious.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs they said: &quot;This is nothing but magic he has contrived, for we have not heard of this from our fathers of old.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="But Moses said: &quot;My Lord knows well who has come with guidance from Him, and for whom is the guerdon of Paradise. But surely the wicked will not prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="The Pharaoh said: &quot;O nobles, I am not aware of any other lord of yours but myself. So, O Haman, fire some clay (bricks) to build a tower for me that I may mount up (and see) the God of Moses; for I think he is a liar.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="He and his soldiers had become arrogant in the land for no reason, and did not think that they have to come back to Us in the end."/>
		<aya index="40" text="So We seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea. Behold then how was the end of the wicked!"/>
		<aya index="41" text="We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped."/>
		<aya index="42" text="A curse lies upon them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be despised."/>
		<aya index="43" text="After We had destroyed the earlier generations We gave Moses the Book as evidence for mankind, and a guidance and grace, so that they may remember."/>
		<aya index="44" text="You were not there on the western side (of Mount Sinai) when We gave the commandments to Moses, nor were you witness (to the event)."/>
		<aya index="45" text="We raised (many more) generations and prolonged their lives. You did not live with the people of Midian, nor recited to them Our revelations; but We kept on sending messengers."/>
		<aya index="46" text="You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called. And all this (knowledge that you are given) is by the grace of your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no admonisher had come before you, that they may take heed;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="And in case disaster comes upon them for what they have done themselves, they should say: &quot;O Lord, why did You not send an apostle to us that we should have followed Your commands, and been with those who are believers;&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: &quot;Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?&quot; Did they not disbelieve before in what was given to Moses? They said: &quot;Both are imposters one like the other,&quot; and added: &quot;We do not believe in either.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say: &quot;Then bring a Book from God which gives better guidance than these so that I may follow it, if you speak the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="Then, if they cannot give you an answer, know that they are only following their lusts. And who can be farther astray than he who follows his lust without any guidance from God? And certainly God does not guide an unjust people."/>
		<aya index="51" text="We have been sending word to them that they may take a warning."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when it is read out to them, say: &quot;We believe in it. It's the truth from our Lord. We had committed ourselves before it came.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="These will be given their recompense twice, for they persevered and repelled evil with good, and spent of what We had given them."/>
		<aya index="55" text="When they hear idle talk they turn aside and say: &quot;To us our actions, to you yours. Peace on you; we do not look for the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="You cannot guide any one you like: God guides whosoever He please. He knows best who will come to guidance."/>
		<aya index="57" text="They say: &quot;If we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force.&quot; Have We not set up a sanctuary for them, to which is brought a wealth of everything as provision from Us? But most of them do not understand."/>
		<aya index="58" text="How many habitations that had come to boast of their resources have We destroyed? These their dwellings were never inhabited except rarely after them; and they came back to Us."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But your Lord does not destroy habitations without having sent an apostle to their metropolis to read out Our commandments to them. We would never have destroyed cities if their inhabitants were not given to wickedness."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding. Will you not understand?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Can one who was given a better promise, which he will find come true, be like him who was given a little enjoyment of this life, but who will afterwards be brought (to judgement) on the Day of Resurrection?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="That day God will call them and ask: &quot;Where are they you imagined were My compeers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those against whom the sentence is justified will say: &quot;O Lord, these are those we had led astray as we had ourselves gone astray. We clear ourselves before You: They never worshipped us.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="(The sinners) will be told: &quot;Invoke your partners.&quot; They will call on them, but they will not answer; and they will see the torment (and wish) if only they had come to guidance."/>
		<aya index="65" text="(God) will ask them on that day: &quot;What answer did you give the apostles?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Then all news will be blacked out for them, and they will not even ask one another."/>
		<aya index="67" text="But he who repents and believes and does good things may well be among the successful."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. The good is not for them to choose. Too holy and high is God for what they associate with Him."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Your Lord well knows what they hide in their breasts and what they disclose."/>
		<aya index="70" text="He is God. There is no god but He. His alone is praise first and last, and His the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Say: &quot;Just think, if God were to cover you up with night for ever until the Day of Doom, what other god apart from God will give you light? Why do you not pay heed?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say: &quot;Just think. If God were to make the day perpetual till the Day of Resurrection, what other god but God would bring you night for rest? Why do you not reflect?"/>
		<aya index="73" text="Yet in His benevolence He made you night and day that you may rest and seek His bounty during them, and haply maybe grateful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Upon a day He will call them and ask: &quot;Where are they you imagined were My compeers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="And We shall single out one witness from each community and say: &quot;Bring your proof.&quot; Then will they know that God's is the judgement, and what they contrived will avail them not in the least."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Verily Qarun was of Moses' people, but he began to oppress them. We had given him treasures, so many that a team of wrestlers could hardly lift their keys. His people said to him: &quot;Do not be exultant. God does not like those who exult."/>
		<aya index="77" text="So seek the abode of the Hereafter through what God has given you, and do not forget your part in this world. Do good to others as God has done good to you, and do not try to spread corruption in the land. Surely God does not like corrupters.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="He said: &quot;This has come to me through my own acumen.&quot; Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations before him who possessed far more acumen than he, and more wealth? The sinners will not be asked about their sins."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Then he came before his people in all pomp; and those enamoured of this world, said: &quot;Ah would that we had what Qarun has been given! He indeed possesses great good fortune.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="But those who knew better, said: &quot;Alack-a-day! God's guerdon is better for those who believe and do the right. Only those who persevere will receive it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="So We opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion. There was not a body that could help him against (the will) of God, nor was he able to save himself."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: &quot;Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases. Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us. Surely the infidels will not succeed.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="We shall give the mansion of the Hereafter to those who do not want to be haughty in the land and spread corruption. The future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Whoever does good will receive better than what he has done; and whoever does ill shall be requited but to the extent of what he does."/>
		<aya index="85" text="He who has assigned (the propagation) of the Qur'an to you will bring you back to the destination. Say: &quot;My Lord knows who has come to guidance, and who is clearly in error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="You did not expect that the Book would be given to you except by the favour of your Lord. So do not be the helper of unbelievers,"/>
		<aya index="87" text="Nor should you let them turn you away from the commandments of God once they have been delivered to you; and call them to your Lord, and do not be an idolater,"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And do not call on any other god apart from God. There is no god but He. All things will perish save His magnificence. His is the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end."/>

God's command is to be fulfilled."/>

This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth. And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen. This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs. It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him. This would indeed be serious in the sight of God."/>

		<aya index="21" text="Follow those who do not ask for any recompense of you, and are rightly guided."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Why should I not worship Him who brought me into being, to whom you will be brought back in the end?"/>

		<aya index="51" text="When the trumpet blast is sounded they will come out of their graves and hasten to their Lord,"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Saying: &quot;Ah woe, who has roused us from our sleep?&quot; This is what Ar-Rahman had promised, and whose truth the apostles had affirmed."/>
		<aya index="53" text="It would be but a single blast of the trumpet, and they would all be arraigned before Us."/>
		<aya index="54" text="No soul will be wronged the least that Day, nor would be recompensed but only for what it had done."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Surely the inmates of Paradise will be engaged in pastimes."/>

		<aya index="67" text="And if We pleased We could paralyse them in their tracks, and they would not be able to move forward or turn back."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Whoever reaches old age, We reverse in natural disposition. Do they not have sense (to see)?"/>
		<aya index="69" text="We have not taught (Muhammad) to versify, nor is it worthy of him. This is nothing but a reminder and illuminating discourse,"/>
		<aya index="70" text="So that he may warn him who is alive and feels, and justify the word against those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Do they not see the cattle among things We have fashioned by Our power, which they own,"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Whom We made subservient to them so that some of them they ride and some they eat?"/>
		<aya index="73" text="And they derive other advantages and drinks from them. Even then they do not offer thanks,"/>

		<aya index="77" text="Does not man see We created him from a drop of semen? Even then he becomes an open contender,"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And applies comparisons to Us, having forgotten his origin, and says: &quot;Who can put life into decayed bones?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="Say: &quot;He who created you the first time. He has knowledge of every creation,"/>
		<aya index="80" text="Who gave you fire from a green tree, with which you ignite the flame.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="How can He who created the heavens and the earth not be able to create others like them? Why not? He is the real creator all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="82" text="When He wills a thing He has only to say: &quot;Be,&quot; and it is."/>

		<aya index="43" text="What you are calling me to is surely not worth the calling in this world or in the next, because our returning is to God; and because the transgressors will be inmates of Hell."/>
		<aya index="44" text="You will remember what I say in time to come; I submit my case to the judgement of God. Surely God keeps an eye on His creatures.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="So God preserved him from the evil they were planning; and a dreadful doom encompassed the people of Pharaoh:"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. The day the Hour is proclaimed (it will be said:) &quot;Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="As they will noisily argue in the Fire, the weaker ones will say to the arrogant: &quot;We were your followers, so will you take over some of our share of the fire?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="The arrogant will answer: &quot;All of us are in it. Surely God has judged between His creatures.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Those in the Fire will say to the warders of Hell: &quot;Ask your Lord to reduce the punishment by a day for us.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="They will say: &quot;Did not your apostles come to you with clear proofs?&quot; They will answer: &quot;Indeed, they did.&quot; &quot;Then pray,&quot; will (the warders) say. But the praying of unbelievers will be all in vain."/>
		<aya index="51" text="We will certainly help Our messengers and those who believe, in this world, and on the day the witnesses take their stand,"/>
		<aya index="52" text="The day upon which their excuses will not benefit the evil-doers, and the condemnation and evil abode will be theirs."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Verily We showed Moses the way, and bequeathed the Book to the children of Israel,"/>
		<aya index="54" text="A guidance and reminder for men of wisdom."/>

		<aya index="56" text="Verily those who argue in the matter of God's revelations, without authority having reached them, have nothing but pride in their hearts, and they will not achieve their end. So take refuge in God: Surely He is all-hearing and all-seeing."/>

		<aya index="58" text="The blind and the seeing are surely not alike, nor those who believe and act rightly and those who do evil. Little do you reflect!"/>

		<aya index="60" text="Your Lord has said: &quot;Call to Me that I may answer your call. Surely those who disdain worshipping Me will enter Hell, disgraced.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="It is God who made the night for you to rest, the day to make things visible. Indeed God is gracious to men, but most men are not grateful."/>
		<aya index="62" text="He is God your Lord, creator of everything. There is no god but He. How then do you turn away (from Him)?"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Only they are turned away thus who deny the signs of God."/>
		<aya index="64" text="It is God who made the earth a dwelling for you, and the sky a vaulted roof, who fashioned you and gave you excellent form and provided you with clean and wholesome things. He is God, your Lord. So blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="65" text="He is the living. There is no god but He. Therefore pray to Him with obedience all-exclusive. Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Say: &quot;I am forbidden to worship those you call apart from God, since clear signs have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="It is He who created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then the embryo; afterwards He brings you forth as a child; then you attain the age of manhood, and then reach old age. But some of you die before you reach the appointed term that you may haply understand."/>
		<aya index="68" text="It is He who gives you life and death. When He creates a thing, He has only to say: &quot;Be,&quot; and it is."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Have you not seen how those who dispute the signs of God are turned away?"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Those who deny the Book and what We have sent down with Our apostles, will soon come to know"/>

		<aya index="72" text="Through boiling water, and then burnt in the Fire."/>
		<aya index="73" text="They will then be asked: &quot;Where are they you took as partners"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Apart from God?&quot; They will answer: &quot;They have left us in the lurch and fled. In fact it was nothing that we prayed to before.&quot; That is how God sends the unbelievers astray."/>
		<aya index="75" text="&quot;This is so because you went about exulting wrongfully in the land,&quot; (will they be told), &quot;and you were insolent."/>
		<aya index="76" text="So enter the gates of Hell to abide in it for ever.&quot; How evil the abode of the arrogant!"/>
		<aya index="77" text="So you persevere with patience (in your mission). The promise of God is true. Whether We show you some of the punishment We have promised them, or gather you up in death, they have to come back to Us."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Surely We have sent apostles before you, some of whose account We have related to you, and that of some We have not told you. But no apostle was given a miracle unless God dispensed. But when the decree of God comes the sentence is passed with justice; and the lovers of vice and vanity will then come to grief."/>
		<aya index="79" text="It is God who made the cattle for you so that some you ride and some you eat."/>
		<aya index="80" text="There are advantages for you in them, so that you may satisfy your needs through them, and may be borne upon them and on ships."/>
		<aya index="81" text="He shows His signs. How many of God's signs will you then deny?"/>
		<aya index="82" text="Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them who were far more numerous than they and more strong, and have left behind them traces on the earth. And yet nothing of what they did profited them."/>
		<aya index="83" text="For when Our apostles came to them with clear proofs, they boasted and exulted at the knowledge they possessed; but what they used to mock recoiled back on them,"/>
		<aya index="84" text="So that when they saw Our might, they said: &quot;We believe in God the one and single, and reject those we associated (with Him).&quot; --"/>
		<aya index="85" text="But then their affirming served them nothing after they had seen Our torment. This is the law of God that has prevailed among His creatures, Then the unbelievers went to rack and ruin."/>
