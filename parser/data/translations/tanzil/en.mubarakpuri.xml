	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif Lam Mim."/>
		<aya index="2" text="That is Book in which there is no Rayb, guidance for the Muttaqin."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Those Who have faith in the Ghayb and perform Salah, and spend out of what we have provided for them."/>
		<aya index="4" text="And who have faith in what is revealed to you and in what was revealed before you, and in the Hereafter they are certain."/>
		<aya index="5" text="They are on guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be a great torment."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And of mankind, there are some who say: &quot;We believe in Allah and the Last Day&quot; while in fact they do not believe."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They try to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!"/>
		<aya index="10" text="In their hearts is a disease and Allah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And when it is said to them: &quot;Do not make mischief on the earth,&quot; they say: &quot;We are only peacemakers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Verily, they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe,&quot; They say: &quot;Shall we believe as the fools have believed&quot; Verily, they are the fools, but they do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when they meet those who believe, they say: &quot;We believe,&quot; but when they are alone with their Shayatin (devils), they say: &quot;Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly."/>
		<aya index="16" text="These are they who have purchased error with guidance, so their commerce was profitless. And they were not guided."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it illuminated all around him, Allah removed their light and left them in darkness. (So) they could not see."/>
		<aya index="18" text="They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the right path)."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or like a rainstorm in the sky, bringing darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may acquire Taqwa."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He alone has the right to be worshipped)."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our servant (Muhammad), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good deeds, that for them will be Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise). Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: &quot;This is what we were provided with before,&quot; and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e. in the same form but different in taste) and they shall have therein Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives), and they will abide therein forever."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. And as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: &quot;What did Allah intend by this parable&quot; By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only the Fasiqin (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah)."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How can you disbelieve in Allah seeing that you were dead and He gave you life Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the Day of Resurrection) and then unto Him you will return."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa ila the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the Knower of everything."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: &quot;Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.&quot; They said: &quot;Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, ـ while we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You.&quot; He (Allah) said: &quot;I know that which you do not know.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="And He taught Adam all the names (of everything), then He showed them to the angels and said, &quot;Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They (angels) said: &quot;Glory is to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, You are the Knower, the Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: &quot;O Adam! Inform them of their names,&quot; and when he had informed them of their names, He said: &quot;Did I not tell you that I know the Ghayb (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And (remember) when We said to the angels: &quot;Prostrate yourselves before Adam.&quot; And they prostrated except Iblis (Shaytan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said: &quot;O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin (wrongdoers). &quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: &quot;Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said: &quot;Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Hudan (guidance) from Me, and whoever follows My guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) ـ such are the dwellers of the Fire. They shall abide therein forever.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill (your obligations to) My covenant (with you) so that I fulfill (My obligations to) your covenant (with Me), and fear none but Me."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in what I have sent down (this Qur'an), confirming that which is with you (the Tawrah and the Injil), and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and buy not with My verses (the Tawrah and the Injil) a small price (i.e. getting a small gain by selling My verses), and fear Me and Me alone."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And mix not truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know (the truth)."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And perform As-Salah, and give Zakah, and bow down along with Ar-Raki`in."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and every act of obedience to Allah) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture (Tawrah)! Have you then no sense."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashi`in."/>
		<aya index="46" text="(They are those) who are certain that they are going to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are going to return."/>
		<aya index="47" text="O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the `Alamin (nations)"/>
		<aya index="48" text="And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him, nor will compensation be taken from him, nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="49" text="And (remember) when We delivered you from Fir`awn's (Pharaoh) people, who were afflicting you with a horrible torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and therein was a mighty trial from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And (remember) when We separated the sea for you and saved you and drowned Fir`awn's (Pharaoh) people while you were watching."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And (remember) when We appointed for Musa (Moses) forty nights, and (in his absence) you took the calf (for worship), and you were Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers)."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Then after that We forgave you so that you might be grateful."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And (remember) when We gave Musa the Scripture (the Tawrah) and the criterion (of right and wrong) so that you may be guided aright."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And (remember) when Musa said to his people: &quot;O my people! Verily, you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf. So turn in repentance to your Creator and kill yourselves (the innocent kill the wrongdoers among you), that will be better for you with your Creator.&quot; Then He accepted your repentance. Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And (remember) when you said: &quot;O Musa! We shall never believe in you until we see Allah plainly.&quot; But you were seized with a bolt of lightning while you were looking."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And We shaded you with clouds and sent down on you Al-Manna and the quail, (saying): &quot;Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you,&quot; (but they rebelled). And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And (remember) when We said: &quot;Enter this town (Jerusalem) and eat bountifully therein with pleasure and delight wherever you wish, and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with humility) and say: `Forgive us,' and We shall forgive you your sins and shall increase (reward) for the good-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrongdoers Rijz (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebellion."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And (remember) when Musa asked for water for his people, We said: &quot;Strike the stone with your stick.&quot; Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each (group of) people knew its own place for water. &quot;Eat and drink of that which Allah has provided and do not act corruptly, making mischief on the earth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="And (remember) when you said, &quot;O Musa! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumber its Fum, its lentils and its onions.&quot; He said, &quot;Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!&quot; And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidence) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes and sins.)"/>
		<aya index="62" text="Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians (Sabi'in), whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And (O Children of Isra'il, remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying): &quot;Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein so that you may acquire Taqwa."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then after that you turned away. Had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, indeed you would have been among the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: &quot;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="So We made this punishment an example for those in front of it and those behind it, and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious)."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And (remember) when Musa said to his people: &quot;Verily, Allah commands you that you slaughter a cow.&quot; They said, &quot;Do you make fun of us&quot; He said, &quot;I take Allah's refuge from being among Al-Jahilin (the ignorant or the foolish).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said, &quot;Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!&quot; He said, &quot;He says, `Verily, it is a cow neither too old nor too young, but (it is) between the two conditions', so do what you are commanded.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said, &quot;Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us its colour.&quot; He said, &quot;He says, `It is a yellow cow, bright in its colour, pleasing the beholders.' &quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said, &quot;Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is. Verily, to us all cows are alike. And surely, if Allah wills, we will be guided.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="He (Musa) said, &quot;He says, `It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields, sound, having no blemish in it.' &quot; They said, &quot;Now you have brought the truth.&quot; So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And (remember) when you killed a man and disagreed among yourselves as to the crime. But Allah brought forth that which you were Taktumun."/>
		<aya index="73" text="So We said: &quot;Strike him (the dead man) with a piece of it (the cow).&quot; Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His Ayat (proofs, evidences, etc.) so that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then after that your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness. And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawrah), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it"/>
		<aya index="76" text="And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say, &quot;We believe,&quot; but when they meet one another in private, they say, &quot;Shall you (Jews) tell them (Muslims) what Allah has revealed to you that they (Muslims) may argue with you (Jews) about it before your Lord&quot; Have you (Jews) then no understanding"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Know they (Jews) not that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And there are among them (Jews) `Ummyyun (unlettered) people, who know not the Book, but they trust upon Amani (false desires) and they but guess."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Then woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, &quot;This is from Allah,&quot; to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And they (Jews) say, &quot;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&quot; Say (O Muhammad to them): &quot;Have you taken a covenant from Allah, so that Allah will not break His covenant Or is it that you say of Allah what you know not&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Yes! Whosoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him, they are dwellers of the Fire (i.e. Hell); they will dwell therein forever."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those who believe and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah (alone) and be dutiful and good to parents, and to kindred, and to orphans and (the poor), and speak good to people and perform As-Salah and give Zakah. Then you slid back, except a few of you, while you are backsliders."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And (remember) when We took your covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your (people), nor turn out your own people from their dwellings. Then, (this) you ratified and (to this) you bore witness."/>
		<aya index="85" text="After this, it is you who kill one another and drive out a party of you from their homes, assist (their enemies) against them, in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. Then do you believe in a part of the Book and reject the rest Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous torment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Those are they who have bought the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their torment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And indeed, We gave Musa the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave `Isa, the son of Maryam, clear signs and supported him with Ruh-il-Qudus. Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant Some you disbelieved and some you killed."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say, &quot;Our hearts are Ghulf.&quot; Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is that which they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur'an) from Allah confirming what is with them (the Tawrah) and the Injil (Gospel), although aforetime they had invoked Allah (for the coming of Muhammad) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it. So let the curse of Allah be on the disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="90" text="How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves, that they should disbelieve in that which Allah has revealed (the Qur'an), grudging that Allah should reveal of His grace unto whom He wills of His servants. So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers, there is disgracing torment."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when it is said to them (the Jews), &quot;Believe in what Allah has sent down,&quot; they say, &quot;We believe in what was sent down to us.&quot; And they disbelieve in that which came after it, while it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say (O Muhammad to them): &quot;Why then have you killed the Prophets of Allah aforetime, if you indeed have been believers&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="And indeed Musa came to you with clear proofs, yet you worshipped the calf after he left, and you were Zalimun."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And (remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying), &quot;Hold firmly to what We have given you and hear (Our Word).&quot; They said, &quot;We have heard and disobeyed.&quot; And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief. Say: &quot;Worst indeed is that which your faith enjoins on you if you are believers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say to (them): &quot;If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is indeed for you especially and not for others of mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them (i.e. what they have done). And Allah is Aware of the Zalimin."/>
		<aya index="96" text="And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who ascribe partners to Allah. One of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from (due) punishment. And Allah is Seer of what they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say (O Muhammad): &quot;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming what came before it (i.e. the Tawrah and the Injil) and guidance and glad tidings for the believers."/>
		<aya index="98" text="&quot;Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika'il, then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayat and none disbelieve in them but Fasiqun (those who rebel against Allah's command)."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah (i.e. Muhammad) confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know!"/>
		<aya index="102" text="They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman (Solomon). Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, &quot;We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).&quot; And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their own selves, if they but knew."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And if they had believed and guarded themselves from evil and kept their duty to Allah, far better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!"/>
		<aya index="104" text="O you who believe! Say not (to the Messenger) Ra`ina but say Unzurna (make us understand) and hear. And for the disbelievers there is a painful torment."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Neither those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) nor Al-Mushrikin (the idolaters) like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord. But Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh (We abrogate) or Nunsiha (cause to be forgotten), We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is Able to do all things"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Know you not that it is Allah to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth And besides Allah you have neither any Wali (protector or guardian) nor any helper."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Or do you want to ask your Messenger (Muhammad) as Musa (Moses) was asked before (i.e. show us openly our Lord) And he who changes faith for disbelief, verily, he has gone astray from the right way."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves, even after the truth (that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger) has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command. Verily, Allah is able to do all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And perform the Salah and give the Zakah, and whatever of good you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allah. Certainly, Allah is the Seer of what you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say, &quot;None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&quot; These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad), &quot;Produce your Burhan if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Yes! But whoever submits his face (himself) to Allah (i.e. follows Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism) and he is a Muhsin then his reward is with his Lord (Allah), on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said those (the pagans) who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allah's Name be mentioned (i.e. prayers and invocations) in Allah's Masjids and strive for their ruin It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah's Masjids) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="115" text="And to Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely, Allah is Sufficient (for His creatures' needs), Knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allah has begotten a son (children or offspring). Glory is to Him (Exalted is He above all that they associate with Him). Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth, and all are Qanitun to Him."/>
		<aya index="117" text="The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it: &quot;Be! ـ and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And those who have no knowledge say: &quot;Why does not Allah speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us&quot; So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike, We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) with the truth (Islam), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, that they will enter the Hellfire). And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad) till you follow their religion. Say: &quot;Verily, the guidance of Allah (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) that is the (only) guidance.

		<aya index="120" text="It was neither befitting for the people of Al-Madinah and the bedouins of the neighborhood to remain behind Allah's Messenger nor to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they suffer neither Zama' nor Nasab, nor Makhmasah in the cause of Allah, nor did they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy, but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allah wastes not the reward of the doers of good."/>

		<aya index="91" text="Now (you believe) while you refused to believe before and you were one of the mischief-makers."/>

		<aya index="1" text="Alif-Lam-Ra. These are the verses of the Book that is clear."/>
		<aya index="2" text="Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an in order that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We relate unto you the best of stories through Our revelations unto you, of this Qur'an. And before this, you were among those who knew nothing about it."/>
		<aya index="4" text="(Remember) when Yusuf said to his father: &quot;O my father! Verily, I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon - I saw them prostrating themselves to me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="5" text="He (the father) said: &quot;O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you. Verily, Shaytan is to man an open enemy!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="6" text="&quot;Thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of dreams (and other things) and perfect His favor on you and on the offspring of Ya`qub, as He perfected it on your fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq aforetime! Verily, your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="7" text="Verily, in Yusuf and his brethren there were Ayat for those who ask."/>
		<aya index="8" text="When they said: &quot;Truly, Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we, while we are `Usbah (a group). Really, our father is in a plain error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="9" text="&quot;Kill Yusuf or cast him out to some (other) land, so that the favor of your father may be given to you alone, and after that you will be righteous folk.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="10" text="One from among them said: &quot;Kill not Yusuf, but if you must do something, throw him down to the bottom of a well; he will be picked up by some caravan of travelers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="11" text="They said: &quot;O our father! Why do you not trust us with Yusuf though we are indeed his well-wishers&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="&quot;Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and verily, we will take care of him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="He (Ya`qub) said: &quot;Truly, it saddens me that you should take him away. I fear lest a wolf should devour him, while you are careless of him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="14" text="They said: &quot;If a wolf devours him, while we are `Usbah (a group), then surely, we are the losers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="So, when they took him away, they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well, and We revealed to him: &quot;Indeed, you shall (one day) inform them of this their affair, when they know (you) not.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="And they came to their father in the early part of the night weeping."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They said: &quot;O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Yusuf by our belongings and a wolf devoured him; but you will never believe us even when we speak the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="And they brought his shirt stained with false blood. He said: &quot;Nay, but your own selves have made up a tale. So (for me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought against that (lie) which you describe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="And there came a caravan of travelers and they sent their water-drawer, and he let down his bucket (into the well). He said: &quot;What good news! Here is a boy.&quot; So they hid him as merchandise (a slave). And Allah was the All-Knower of what they did."/>
		<aya index="20" text="And they sold him for a Bakhs price, - for a few Dirhams. And they were of those who regarded him insignificant."/>
		<aya index="21" text="And he (the man) from Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: &quot;Make his stay comfortable, maybe he will profit us or we shall adopt him as a son.&quot; Thus did We establish Yusuf in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah has full power and control over His affairs, but most of men know not."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he [Yusuf] attained his full manhood, We gave him wisdom and knowledge (the prophethood), thus We reward the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him (to do an evil act), and she closed the doors and said: &quot;Come on, O you.&quot; He said: &quot;I seek refuge in Allah! Truly, he is my Rabb! He made my living in a great comfort! Verily, the wrongdoers will never be successful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="And indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and immoval sins. Surely, he was one of Our Mukhlasin servants."/>
		<aya index="25" text="So they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. They both found her master (i.e. her husband) at the door. She said: &quot;What is the recompense (punishment) for him who intended an evil design against your wife, except that he be put in prison or a painful torment&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="He [Yusuf] said: &quot;It was she that sought to seduce me;&quot; and a witness of her household bore witness (saying): &quot;If it be that his shirt is torn from the front, then her tale is true and he is a liar!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="&quot;But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then she has told a lie and he is speaking the truth!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="So when he (her husband) saw his [Yusuf`s] shirt torn at the back, he (her husband) said: &quot;Surely, it is a plot of you women! Certainly mighty is your plot!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="&quot;O Yusuf! Turn away from this! (O woman!) Ask forgiveness for your sin, verily, you were of the sinful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="And women in the city said: &quot;The wife of the `Aziz is seeking to seduce her (slave) young man, indeed she loves him violently; verily, we see her in plain error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="So when she heard of their accusation, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them; she gave each one of them a knife, and she said [to Yusuf]: &quot;Come out before them.&quot; Then, when they saw him, they exalted him (at his beauty) and (in their astonishment) cut their hands. They said: &quot;How perfect is Allah! No man is this! This is none other than a noble angel!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="She said: &quot;This is he (the young man) about whom you did blame me, and I did seek to seduce him, but he refused. And now if he refuses to obey my order, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and will be one of those who are disgraced.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: &quot;O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one of the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="So his Lord answered his invocation and turned away from him their plot. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the proofs (of his innocence), to imprison him for a time."/>
		<aya index="36" text="And there entered with him two young men in the prison. One of them said: &quot;Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) pressing wine.&quot; The other said: &quot;Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof.&quot; (They said): &quot;Inform us of the interpretation of this. Verily, we think you are one of the doers of good.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="He said: &quot;No food will come to you as your provision, but I will inform its interpretation before it comes. This is of that which my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have abandoned the religion of a people that believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="&quot;And I have followed the religion of my fathers, - Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya'qub and never could we attribute any partners whatsoever to Allah. This is from the grace of Allah to us and to mankind, but most men thank not."/>
		<aya index="39" text="&quot;O two companions of the prison! Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah, the One, the Irresistible&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="&quot;You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged) - you and your fathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him; that is the straight religion, but most men know not.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="41" text="&quot;O two companions of the prison! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his master to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="And he said to the one whom he knew to be saved: &quot;Mention me to your king.&quot; But Shaytan made him forget to mention it to his master. So [Yusuf] stayed in prison a few (more) years."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And the king (of Egypt) said: &quot;Verily, I saw (in a dream) seven fat cows, whom seven lean ones were devouring, and seven green ears of corn, and (seven) others dry. O notables! Explain to me my dream, if it be that you can interpret dreams.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="44" text="They said: &quot;Mixed up false dreams and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Then the man who was released, now at length remembered and said: &quot;I will tell you its interpretation, so send me forth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="46" text="(He said): &quot;O Yusuf, the man of truth! Explain to us seven fat cows whom seven lean ones were devouring, and seven green ears of corn, and (seven) others dry, that I may return to the people, and that they may know.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="[Yusuf] said: &quot;For seven consecutive years, you shall sow as usual and that which you reap you shall leave it in the ears, (all) except a little of it which you may eat.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="&quot;Then will come after that, seven hard (years), which will devour what you have laid by in advance for them, (all) except a little of that which you have guarded (stored).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="&quot;Then thereafter will come a year in which people will have abundant rain and in which they will press (wine and oil).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="And the king said: &quot;Bring him to me.&quot; But when the messenger came to him, [Yusuf] said: &quot;Return to your king and ask him, `What happened to the women who cut their hands Surely, my Lord (Allah) is Well-Aware of their plot.&quot;'"/>
		<aya index="51" text="(The king) said (to the women): &quot;What was your affair when you did seek to seduce Yusuf&quot; The women said: &quot;Allah forbid! No evil know we against him!&quot; The wife of the `Aziz said: &quot;Now the truth is manifest (to all); it was I who sought to seduce him, and he is surely of the truthful. &quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="[Then Yusuf said: &quot;I asked for this inquiry] in order that he may know that I betrayed him not in (his) absence.&quot; And, verily, Allah guides not the plot of the betrayers."/>
		<aya index="53" text="&quot;And I free not myself (from the blame). Verily, the self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His mercy (upon whom He wills). Verily, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="And the king said: &quot;Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person.&quot; Then, when he spoke to him, he said: &quot;Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="55" text="[Yusuf] said: &quot;Set me over the storehouses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="Thus did We give full authority to Yusuf in the land, to take possession therein, when or where he likes. We bestow of Our mercy on whom We will, and We make not to be lost the reward of the good doers."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And verily, the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and had Taqwa."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And Yusuf's brethren came and they entered unto him, and he recognized them, but they recognized him not."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And when he furnished them with their provisions, he said: &quot;Bring me a brother of yours from your father. See you not that I give full measure, and that I am the best of the hosts&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="&quot;But if you bring him not to me, there shall be no measure (of corn) for you with me, nor shall you come near me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="They said: &quot;We shall try to get permission (for him) from his father, and verily, we shall do it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="And [Yusuf] told his servants to put their money into their bags, so that they might know it when they go back to their people; in order that they might come again."/>
		<aya index="63" text="So, when they returned to their father, they said: &quot;O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother). So send our brother with us, and we shall get our measure and truly, we will guard him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="He said: &quot;Can I entrust him to you except as I entrusted his brother [Yusuf] to you aforetime But Allah is the Best to guard, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="And when they opened their bags, they found their money had been returned to them. They said: &quot;O our father! What (more) can we desire This, our money has been returned to us; so we shall get (more) food for our family, and we shall guard our brother and add one more measure of a camel's load. This quantity is easy (for the king to give).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="He [Ya`qub] said: &quot;I will not send him with you until you swear a solemn oath to me in Allah's Name, that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded (by enemies),&quot; And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: &quot;Allah is the Witness to what we have said.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="And he said: &quot;O my sons! Do not enter by one gate, but enter by different gates, and I cannot avail you against Allah at all. Verily, the decision rests only with Allah. In Him, I put my trust and let all those that trust, put their trust in Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="And when they entered according to their father's advice, it did not avail them in the least against (the will of) Allah; it was but a need of Ya`qub's inner self which he discharged. And verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And when they went in before Yusuf, he took his brother (Binyamin) to himself and said: &quot;Verily, I am your brother, so grieve not for what they used to do.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="So when he furnished them forth with their provisions, he put the bowl in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried: &quot;O you (in) the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="They, turning towards them, said: &quot;What is it that you have lost&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They said: &quot;We have lost the bowl of the king and for him who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load; and I will be bound by it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said: &quot;By Allah! Indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="They said: &quot;What then shall be the penalty of him, if you are (proved to be) liars.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="They [Yusuf's brothers] said: &quot;His penalty should be that he, in whose bag it is found, should be held for the punishment (of the crime). Thus we punish the wrongdoers!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="So he [Yusuf] began (the search) in their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Yusuf. He could not take his brother by the law of the king (as a slave), except that Allah willed it. We raise to degrees whom We will, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah)."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They [Yusuf's brothers] said: &quot;If he steals, there was a brother of his [Yusuf] who did steal before (him). &quot; But these things did Yusuf keep in himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He said (within himself): &quot;You are in an evil situation, and Allah is the Best Knower of that which you describe!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said: &quot;O `Aziz! Verily, he has an old father (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place. Indeed we think that you are one of the doers of good.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="He said: &quot;Allah forbid, that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property. Indeed (if we did so), we should be wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="So, when they despaired of him, they consulted in private. The eldest among them said: &quot;Know you not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's Name, and before this you did fail in your duty with Yusuf Therefore I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah decides my case and He is the Best of the judges."/>
		<aya index="81" text="&quot;Return to your father and say, `O our father! Verily, your son has stolen, and we testify not except according to what we know, and we could not know the Unseen!"/>
		<aya index="82" text="&quot;And ask (the people of) the town where we have been, and the caravan in which we returned; and indeed we are telling the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="He [Ya`qub] said: &quot;Nay, but your own selves have beguiled you into something. So patience is most fitting (for me). May be Allah will bring them (back) all to me. Truly, He! Only He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="And he turned away from them and said: &quot;Alas, my grief for Yusuf!&quot; And he lost his sight because of the sorrow that he was suppressing."/>
		<aya index="85" text="They said: &quot;By Allah! You will never cease remembering Yusuf until you become weak with old age, or until you be of the dead.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="He said: &quot;I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you know not.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="&quot;O my sons! Go you and inquire about Yusuf and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah's mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allah's mercy, except the people who disbelieve.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="Then, when they entered unto him, they said: &quot;O `Aziz! A hard time has hit us and our family, and we have brought but poor capital, so pay us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, Allah does reward the charitable.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He said: &quot;Do you know what you did with Yusuf and his brother, when you were ignorant&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They said: &quot;Are you indeed Yusuf&quot; He said: &quot;I am Yusuf, and this is my brother. Allah has indeed been gracious to us. He who has Taqwa, and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the gooddoers to be lost.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: &quot;By Allah! Indeed Allah has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been sinners.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said: &quot;No reproach on you this day; may Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!"/>
		<aya index="93" text="&quot;Go with this shirt of mine, and cast it over the face of my father, his vision will return, and bring to me all your family.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when the caravan departed, their father said: &quot;I do indeed sense the smell of Yusuf, if only you think me not senile.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="They said: &quot;By Allah! Certainly, you are in your old Dalal (error).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="Then, when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast it (the shirt) over his face, and his vision returned. He said: &quot;Did I not say to you, `I know from Allah that which you know not&quot;'"/>
		<aya index="97" text="They said: &quot;O our father! Ask forgiveness (from Allah) for our sins, indeed we have been sinners.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said: &quot;I will ask my Lord for forgiveness for you, verily, He! Only He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Then, when they came in before Yusuf, he took his parents to himself and said: &quot;Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, in security.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="100" text="And he raised his parents to the `Arsh and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: &quot;O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream aforetime! My Lord has made it come true! He was indeed good to me, when He took me out of the prison, and brought you (all here) out of the bedouin life, after Shaytan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Certainly, my Lord is the Most Courteous and Kind unto whom He wills. Truly, He! Only He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."/>
		<aya index="101" text="&quot;My Lord! You have indeed bestowed on me of the sovereignty, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams - the (Only) Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Wali in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim, and join me with the righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="102" text="That is of the news of the Ghayb (Unseen) which We reveal to you. You were not (present) with them when they arranged their plan together, and (while) they were plotting."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly."/>
		<aya index="104" text="And no reward you ask of them for it; it (the Qur'an) is no less than a Reminder unto the `Alamin (men and Jinn)."/>
		<aya index="105" text="And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth they pass by, while they are averse therefrom."/>
		<aya index="106" text="And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the torment of Allah, or of the coming against them of the (Final) Hour, all of a sudden while they perceive not"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Say &quot;This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me. And Glorified and Exalted be Allah. And I am not of the idolators.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="109" text="And We sent not before you (as Messengers) any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships. Have they not traveled in the land and seen what was the end of those who were before them And verily, the home of the Hereafter is the best for those who have Taqwa. Do you not then understand"/>
		<aya index="110" text="(They were reprieved) until, when the Messengers gave up hope and thought that they were denied, then came to them Our help, and whomsoever We willed were rescued. And Our punishment cannot be warded off from the people who are criminals."/>
		<aya index="111" text="Indeed in their stories, there is a lesson for men of understanding. It (the Qur'an) is not a forged statement but a confirmation of that which was before it and a detailed explanation of everything and a guide and a mercy for the people who believe."/>

		<aya index="66" text="And there is indeed a lesson for you in the An'am (cattle). We have made a drink for you out of what is in its belly, from between excretions and blood, pure milk; palatable to the drinkers."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And from the fruits of date palms and grapes, you derive strong drink and a goodly provision. There is indeed a sign in this for those of reason."/>

Then, those who are so honored will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those (captives of war) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in that. Do they then deny the favor of Allah"/>
		<aya index="72" text="And Allah has made for you mates of your own kind, and has made for you, from your mates, sons and grandsons, and has granted you good provisions. Do they then believe in false deities and deny favor of Allah"/>

		<aya index="74" text="So do not give examples on behalf of Allah. Truly, Allah knows and you know not."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Allah gives the example of a servant under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and a man on whom We have bestowed good provisions from Us, and he spends from that secretly and openly. Can they be equal (By no means). All the praises and thanks are to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them know not."/>
		<aya index="76" text="And Allah gives an example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything, and he is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who commands justice, and is himself on the straight path"/>
		<aya index="77" text="And to Allah belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Truly, Allah is able to do all things."/>
		<aya index="78" text="And Allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing. And He gave you hearing, sight, and hearts, that you might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Do they not see the birds held (flying) in the midst of the sky None holds them up but Allah. Verily, in this are clear signs for people who believe."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And Allah had made your homes a place of rest for you, and made dwellings for you out of the hides of the cattle which you find so light when you travel and when you camp; and furnishings and articles of convenience out of their wool, fur, and hair - comfort for a while."/>
		<aya index="81" text="And Allah has made shade for you out of that which He has created, and He has made places of refuge in the mountains for you, and He has made garments for you to protect you from the heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your violence. Thus does He perfect His favor for you, that you may submit yourselves to His will."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Then, if they turn away, your duty (O Muhammad) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way."/>
		<aya index="83" text="They recognize the grace of Allah, yet they deny it (by worshipping others besides Allah) and most of them are disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And on the Day when We resurrect a witness from each nation, then those who disbelieve will not be given leave, nor will they be allowed (to return to the world) to repent and ask for Allah's forgiveness."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And once those who did wrong see the torment, it will not decrease for them, nor will they be given respite."/>
		<aya index="86" text="And when those who associated partners with Allah see their partners, they will say: &quot;Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to call upon besides you.&quot; But they will throw back their statement at them (saying): &quot;You indeed are liars!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="And they will offer (their full) submission to Allah on that Day, and what they falsely invented will wander away from them."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Those who disbelieved and tried to obstruct the path of Allah, for them We will add torment on top of the torment because of the corruption they spread."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And on the Day when We resurrect a witness from each nation from among themselves, and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these. And We have revealed the Book (the Qur'an) to you as an explanation of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and good news for the Muslims."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Verily, Allah orders justice and kindness, and giving (help) to the relatives, and He forbids immoral sins, and evil and tyranny. He admonishes you, so that perhaps you may take heed."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And fulfill the covenants (taken in the Name of) Allah when you have taken them, and do not break the oaths after you have confirmed them - and indeed you have appointed Allah as your guarantor. Verily, Allah knows what you do."/>
		<aya index="92" text="And do not be like the one who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong, by taking your oaths as a means of deception among yourselves when one group is more numerous than another group. Allah only tests you by this, and on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly clarify that which used to differ over."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And had Allah willed, He would have made you (all) one nation, but He allows whom He wills to stray and He guides whom He wills. But you shall certainly be called to account for what you used to do."/>
		<aya index="94" text="And do not make your oaths a means of deception among yourselves, resulting in the slip of a foot after it was firmly planted, and you taste the evil of having hindered from the path of Allah, and you will suffer a terrible punishment."/>
		<aya index="95" text="And do not use an oath by Allah for the purchase of little value, what is with Allah is better for you if you only knew."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Whatever you have will be exhausted, and what is with Allah will remain. And to those who are patient, We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Whoever does righteous deeds - whether male or female - while he (or she) is a believer; then We will certainly give them a good life, and We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="98" text="So when you recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord."/>
		<aya index="100" text="His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Shaytan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah)."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And when We change a verse in place of another - and Allah knows best what He reveals - they (the disbelievers) say: &quot;You (O Muhammad) are but a forger.&quot; Rather, most of them know not."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Say (O Muhammad); &quot;Ruh-ul-Qudus has brought it (the Qur'an) down from your Lord with truth.&quot; for the conviction of those who believe, and as a guide and good news for the Muslims."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: &quot;It is only a human being who teaches him.&quot; The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Qur'an) is (in) a clear Arabic tongue."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Verily, those who do not believe in Allah's Ayat (signs, or revelation), Allah will not guide them, and theirs will be a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="105" text="It is only those who do not believe in Allah's Ayat who fabricate the falsehood, and it is they who are liars."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief - except one who was forced while his heart is at peace with the faith - but whoever opens their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a terrible torment."/>
		<aya index="107" text="That is because they preferred the life of this world over that of the Hereafter. And Allah does not guide the people who disbelieve."/>
		<aya index="108" text="They are those upon whose hearts, hearing (ears) and sight (eyes) Allah has set a seal over. And they are the heedless!"/>
		<aya index="109" text="No doubt, in the Hereafter they will be the losers."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Then, verily, your Lord for those who emigrated after they were put to trials and then performed Jihad, and were patient, - after this, your Lord is indeed Forgiving, Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="111" text="(Remember) the Day when every person will come pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did, and they will not be dealt with unjustly."/>
		<aya index="112" text="And Allah gives the example of a township (Makkah), it was secure and peaceful: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the favors of Allah. So Allah made it taste extreme hunger (famine) and fear, because of what they did."/>
		<aya index="113" text="There has come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they denied him, so the torment seized them while they were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="114" text="So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah has provided for you. And be grateful for Allah's favor, if it is He Whom you worship."/>
		<aya index="115" text="He has only forbidden dead flesh, blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing, then, Allah is Pardoning, Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And do not describe what your tongues have lied about, saying: &quot;This is lawful and this is forbidden,&quot; to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah, will never succeed."/>
		<aya index="117" text="A passing brief enjoyment (will be theirs), but they will suffer a painful torment."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And for those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you before. And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Then, your Lord for those who did evil out of ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds - verily, after that, your Lord is Pardoning, Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Verily, Ibrahim was (himself) an Ummah, obedient to Allah, a Hanif (monotheist), and he was not one of the idolators."/>
		<aya index="121" text="(He was) thankful for His favors. He (Allah) chose him and guided him to a straight path."/>
		<aya index="122" text="And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous."/>
		<aya index="123" text="Then, We have sent the revelation to you: &quot;Follow the religion of Ibrahim (he was a) Hanif, and he was not one of the idolators.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="124" text="The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it, and verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they differed over."/>
		<aya index="125" text="Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them with that which is best. Truly, your Lord best knows who has strayed from His path, and He best knows those who are guided."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And if you punish them, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you have patience with them, then it is better for those who are patient."/>
		<aya index="127" text="And be patient, and your patience will not be, but by the help of Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do not be distressed by their plots."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Truly, Allah is with those who have Taqwa, and the doers of good."/>

		<aya index="123" text="He (Allah) said: &quot;Get you down, both of you, together, some of you are an enemy to some others. Then if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance he shall neither go astray nor shall be distressed."/>

		<aya index="7" text="(Remember) when Musa said to his household: &quot;Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="But when he came to it, he was called: &quot;Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it! And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="9" text="&quot;O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="10" text="&quot;And throw down your stick!&quot; But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and did not look back. (It was said:) &quot;O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="14" text="And they belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof. So, see what was the end of the mischief-makers."/>
		<aya index="15" text="And indeed We gave knowledge to Dawud and Sulayman, and they both said: &quot;All praise be to Allah, Who has preferred us above many of His believing servants!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="And Sulayman inherited from Dawud. He said: &quot;O mankind! We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from everything. This, verily, is an evident grace.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="17" text="And there were gathered before Sulayman his hosts of Jinn and men, and birds, and they all were set in battle order (marching forward)."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Till, when they came to the valley of the ants, one of the ants said: &quot;O ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Sulayman and his armies should crush you, while they perceive not.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="So he (Sulayman) smiled, amused at her speech and said: &quot;My Lord!

		<aya index="20" text="He inspected the birds, and said: &quot;What is the matter that I see not the hoopoe Or is he among the absentees&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="&quot;I will surely punish him with a severe torment or slaughter him, unless he brings me a clear reason.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="But (the hoopoe) stayed not long, he said: &quot;I have grasped which you have not grasped and I have come to you from Saba' with true news.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="&quot;I found a woman ruling over them, she has been given all things, and she has a great throne.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="&quot;I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them to prevent them from the way, so they have no guidance.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="So they do not prostrate themselves before Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="(Sulayman) said: &quot;We shall see whether you speak the truth or you are (one) of the liars.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="&quot;Go you with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then draw back from them and see what they return.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="She said: &quot;O chiefs! Verily, here is delivered to me a noble letter, &quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="&quot;Verily, it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful;'"/>
		<aya index="31" text="`Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).' &quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="She said: &quot;O chiefs! Advise me in case of mine. I decide no case till you are present with me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="They said: &quot;We have great strength, and great ability for war, but it is for you to command; so think over what you will command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="She said: &quot;Verily, kings, when they enter a town, they destroy it and make the most honorable among its people the lowest. And thus they do.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="&quot;But verily, I am going to send him a present, and see with what (answer) the messengers return.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="So, when (the messengers with the gift) came to Sulayman, he said: &quot;Will you help me in wealth What Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay, you rejoice in your gift!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="&quot;Go back to them. We verily, shall come to them with armies that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be abased.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="He said: &quot;O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience (as Muslims)&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="An `Ifrit from the Jinn said: &quot;I will bring it to you before you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture, said: &quot;I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!&quot; Then when he saw it placed before him, he said: &quot;This is by the grace of my Lord -- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for himself; and whoever is ungrateful, certainly my Lord is Rich, Bountiful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="41" text="He said: &quot;Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided, or she will be one of those not guided.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="So when she came, it was said, &quot;Is your throne like this&quot; She said: &quot;As though it were the very same.&quot; And he said, &quot;Knowledge was bestowed on us before her, and we had submitted to Allah (as Muslims).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="And Saddaha that which she used to worship besides Allah has prevented her (from Islam), for she was of a disbelieving people."/>
		<aya index="44" text="It was said to her: &quot;Enter As-Sarh,&quot; but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (tucked up her clothes) uncovering her legs. Sulayman said: &quot;Verily, it is a Sarh Mumarrad of Qawarir.&quot; She said: &quot;My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit, together with Sulayman to Allah, the Lord of all that exits.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And indeed We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, (saying): &quot;Worship Allah.&quot; Then look! They became two parties quarreling with each other."/>

		<aya index="56" text="There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: &quot;Drive out the family of Lut from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!&quot;"/>

		<aya index="1" text="Ta Sin Mim"/>
		<aya index="2" text="These are the Ayat of the manifest Book."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We recite to you some of the news of Musa and Fir`awn in truth, for a people who believe."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Verily, Fir`awn exalted himself in the land and made its people Shiya`a, weakening a group among them: killing their sons, and letting their females live. Verily, he was of the mischief-makers."/>
		<aya index="5" text="And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land, and to make them rulers and to make them the inheritors,"/>
		<aya index="6" text="And to establish them in the land, and We let Fir`awn and Haman and their armies receive from them that which they feared."/>
		<aya index="7" text="And We inspired the mother of Musa: &quot;Suckle him (Musa), but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of the Messengers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then the household of Fir`awn picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief. Verily, Fir`awn, Haman and their armies were sinners."/>
		<aya index="9" text="And the wife of Fir`awn said: &quot;A comfort of the eye for me and for you. Kill him not, perhaps he may be of benefit to us, or we may adopt him as a son.&quot; And they perceived not."/>
		<aya index="10" text="And the heart of the mother of Musa became empty. She was very near to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart, so that she might remain as one of the believers."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And she said to his sister: &quot;Follow him.&quot; So she watched him from a far place (secretly), while they perceived not."/>
		<aya index="12" text="And We had already forbidden foster suckling mothers for him, until she said: &quot;Shall I direct you to a household who will rear him for you, and look after him in a good manner&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="So We restored him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them know not."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when he reached maturity, and was complete, We bestowed on him Hukm and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="15" text="And he entered the city when its people were unaware: and he found there two men fighting, -- one of his party, and the other of his foes. The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe, so Musa struck him with his fist and he died. He said: &quot;This is of Shaytan's doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="He said: &quot;My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.&quot; Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="17" text="He said: &quot;My Lord! For that with which You have favored me, I will nevermore be a helper of the criminals!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="So he became afraid, looking about in the city, when behold, the man who had sought his help the day before, called for his help (again). Musa said to him: &quot;Verily, you are a plain misleader!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="Then when he decided to seize the man who was an enemy to both of them, the man said: &quot;O Musa! Is it your intention to kill me as you killed a man yesterday Your aim is nothing but to become a tyrant in the land, and not to be one of those who do right.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="20" text="And there came a man running, from the farthest end of the city. He said: &quot;O Musa! Verily, the chiefs are taking counsel together about you, to kill you, so escape. Truly, I am one of the good advisers to you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear. He said: &quot;My Lord! Save me from the people who are wrongdoers!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he went towards Madyan, he said: &quot;It may be that my Lord guides me to the right way.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="And when he arrived at the water of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering, and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: &quot;What is the matter with you&quot; They said: &quot;We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take (their flocks). And our father is a very old man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="So he watered (their flocks) for them, then he turned back to shade, and said: &quot;My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then there came to him one of them, walking shyly. She said: &quot;Verily, my father calls you that he may reward you for having watered (our flocks) for us.&quot; So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: &quot;Fear you not. You have escaped from the people who are wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="And said one of them (the two women): &quot;O my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="He said: &quot;I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten years, it will be (a favor) from you. But I intend not to place you under a difficulty. If Allah wills, you will find me one of the righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="He (Musa) said: &quot;That (is settled) between me and you: whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="Then, when Musa had fulfilled the term, and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of At-Tur. He said to his family: &quot;Wait, I have seen a fire; perhaps I may bring to you from there some information, or a burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="So when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: &quot;O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exists!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="&quot;And throw your stick!&quot; But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and looked not back. (It was said:) &quot;O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="&quot;Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease; and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear. These are two proofs from your Lord to Fir`awn and his chiefs. Verily, they are the people who are rebellious.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: &quot;My Lord! I have killed a man among them, and I fear that they will kill me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="&quot;And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Verily, I fear that they will deny me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Allah said: &quot;We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power, so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our Ayat; you two as well as those who follow you, will be the victors.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Then when Musa came to them with Our Clear Ayat, they said: &quot;This is nothing but invented magic. Never did we hear of this among our fathers of old.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Musa said: &quot;My Lord knows best him who came with guidance from Him, and whose will be the happy end in the Hereafter. Verily, the wrongdoers will not be successful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="Fir`awn said: &quot;O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me. So kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake clay, and set up for me a Sarh in order that I may look at the God of Musa; and verily, I think that he (Musa) is one of the liars.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="And he and his armies were arrogant in the land, without right, and they thought that they would never return to Us."/>
		<aya index="40" text="So, We seized him and his armies, and We threw them all into the sea. So, behold what was the end of the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection, they will be among disgraced."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And indeed We gave Musa -- after We had destroyed the generations of old -- the Scripture as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might remember."/>
		<aya index="44" text="And you were not on the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Musa the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses."/>
		<aya index="45" text="But We created generations, and long were the ages that passed over them. And you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, reciting Our Ayat to them. But it is We Who kept sending (Messengers)."/>
		<aya index="46" text="And you were not at the side of At-Tur when We called. But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, in order that they may remember or receive admonition."/>
		<aya index="47" text="And if (We had) not (sent you to the people of Makkah) in case a calamity should seize them for what their hands have sent forth, they would have said: &quot;Our Lord! Why did You not send us a Messenger We would then have followed Your Ayat and would have been among the believers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But when the truth has come to them from Us, they say: &quot;Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old&quot; They say: &quot;Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!&quot; And they say: &quot;Verily, in both we are disbelievers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say: &quot;Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="But if they answer you not, then know that they only follow their own lusts. And who is more astray than one who follows his own lusts, without guidance from Allah Verily, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And indeed now We have conveyed the Word to them, in order that they may remember."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it, they believe in it."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when it is recited to them, they say: &quot;We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed even before it we have been from Muslims.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="These will be given their reward twice over, because they are patient, and repel evil with good, and spend out of what We have provided for them."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when they hear evil vain talk, they withdraw from it and say: &quot;To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not (the way of) the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are the guided."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And they say: &quot;If we follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land.&quot; Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary, to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And how many a town have We destroyed, which was thankless for its means of livelihood! And those are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited after them except a little. And verily, We have been the heirs."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And never will your Lord destroy the towns until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Ayat. And never would We destroy the towns unless the people thereof are wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And whatever you have been given is an enjoyment of the life of the world and its adornment, and that which is with Allah is better and will remain forever. Have you then no sense"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Is he whom We have promised an excellent promise -- which he will find true -- like him whom We have made to enjoy the luxuries of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those brought up"/>
		<aya index="62" text="And (remember) the Day when He will call to them and say: &quot;Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those about whom the Word will have been fulfilled will say: &quot;Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray, as we were astray ourselves. We declare our innocence before You. It was not us they worshipped.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="And it will be said: &quot;Call upon your partners,&quot; and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them, and they will see the torment. If only they had been guided!"/>
		<aya index="65" text="And the Day He will call to them, and say: &quot;What answer gave you to the Messengers&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Then the news of a good answer will be obscured to them on that Day, and they will not be able to ask one another."/>

		<aya index="7" text="And thus We have revealed to you a Qur'an in Arabic that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it, and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt, a party will be in Paradise and a party in the blazing Fire."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And if Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation, but He admits whom He wills to His mercy. And the wrongdoers will have neither a protector nor a helper."/>
