	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif Lam Mim."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This Book, there is no doubt in it, is a guide to those who guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Those who believe in the unseen and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them."/>
		<aya index="4" text="And who believe in that which has been revealed to you and that which was revealed before you and they are sure of the hereafter."/>
		<aya index="5" text="These are on a right course from their Lord and these it is that shall be successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Surely those who disbelieve, it being alike to them whether you warn them, or do not warn them, will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and there is a covering over their eyes, and there is a great punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the last day; and they are not at all believers."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive."/>
		<aya index="10" text="There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We are but peace-makers."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers, but they do not perceive."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe, they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they themselves are the fools, but they do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; and when they are alone with their Shaitans, they say: Surely we are with you, we were only mocking."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Allah shall pay them back their mockery, and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on."/>
		<aya index="16" text="These are they who buy error for the right direction, so their bargain shall bring no gain, nor are they the followers of the right direction."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire, but when it had illumined all around him, Allah took away their light, and left them in utter darkness-- they do not see."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they will not turn back."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or like abundant rain from the cloud in which is utter darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers into their ears because of the thunder peal, for fear of death, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning almost takes away their sight; whenever it shines on them they walk in it, and when it becomes dark to them they stand still; and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have taken away their hearing and their sight; surely Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O men! serve your Lord Who created you and those before you so that you may guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who made the earth a resting place for you and the heaven a canopy and (Who) sends down rain from the cloud, then brings forth with it subsistence for you of the fruits; therefore do not set up rivals to Allah while you know."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call on your witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you do (it) not and never shall you do (it), then be on your guard against the fire of which men and stones are the fuel; it is prepared for the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall have gardens in which rivers flow; whenever they shall be given a portion of the fruit thereof, they shall say: This is what was given to us before; and they shall be given the like of it, and they shall have pure mates in them, and in them, they shall abide."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that of) a gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land; these it is that are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life? Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life; then you shall be brought back to Him."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, and He directed Himself to the heaven, so He made them complete seven heavens, and He knows all things."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And when your Lord said to the angels, I am going to place in the earth a khalif, they said: What! wilt Thou place in it such as shall make mischief in it and shed blood, and we celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy holiness? He said: Surely I know what you do not know."/>
		<aya index="31" text="And He taught Adam all the names, then presented them to the angels; then He said: Tell me the names of those if you are right."/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said: Glory be to Thee! we have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: O Adam! inform them of their names. Then when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not say to you that I surely know what is ghaib in the heavens and the earth and (that) I know what you manifest and what you hide?"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam they did obeisance, but Iblis (did it not). He refused and he was proud, and he was one of the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish and do not approach this tree, for then you will be of the unjust."/>
		<aya index="36" text="But the Shaitan made them both fall from it, and caused them to depart from that (state) in which they were; and We said: Get forth, some of you being the enemies of others, and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam received (some) words from his Lord, so He turned to him mercifully; surely He is Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said: Go forth from this (state) all; so surely there will come to you a guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="39" text="And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject My communications, they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide."/>
		<aya index="40" text="O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me, I will fulfill (My) covenant with you; and of Me, Me alone, should you be afraid."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in what I have revealed, verifying that which is with you, and be not the first to deny it, neither take a mean price in exchange for My communications; and Me, Me alone should you fear."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood, nor hide the truth while you know (it)."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with those who bow down."/>
		<aya index="44" text="What! do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book; have you then no sense?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And seek assistance through patience and prayer, and most surely it is a hard thing except for the humble ones,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him."/>
		<aya index="47" text="O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations."/>
		<aya index="48" text="And be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not avail another in the least, neither shall intercession on its behalf be accepted, nor shall any compensation be taken from it, nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="49" text="And when We delivered you from Firon's people, who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned the followers of Firon and you watched by."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And when We appointed a time of forty nights with Musa, then you took the calf (for a god) after him and you were unjust."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when We gave Musa the Book and the distinction that you might walk aright."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And when Musa said to his people: O my people! you have surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for a god), therefore turn to your Creator (penitently), so kill your people, that is best for you with your Creator: so He turned to you (mercifully), for surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when you said: O Musa! we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly, so the punishment overtook you while you looked on."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to you manna and quails: Eat of the good things that We have given you; and they did not do Us any harm, but they made their own souls suffer the loss."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and say, forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good (to others)."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them, so We sent upon those who were unjust a pestilence from heaven, because they transgressed."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And when Musa prayed for drink for his people, We said: Strike the rock with your staff. So there gushed from it twelve springs; each tribe knew its drinking place: Eat and drink of the provisions of Allah and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief."/>
		<aya index="61" text="And when you said: O Musa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for. And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they became deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain over you: Take hold of the law (Tavrat) We have given you with firmness and bear in mind what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then you turned back after that; so were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have been among the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated."/>
		<aya index="66" text="So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who came after it, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And when Musa said to his people: Surely Allah commands you that you should sacrifice a cow; they said: Do you ridicule us? He said: I seek the protection of Allah from being one of the ignorant."/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow neither advanced in age nor too young, of middle age between that (and this); do therefore what you are commanded."/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what her color is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a yellow cow; her color is intensely yellow, giving delight to the beholders."/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is, for surely to us the cows are all alike, and if Allah please we shall surely be guided aright."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow not made submissive that she should plough the land, nor does she irrigate the tilth; sound, without a blemish in her. They said: Now you have brought the truth; so they sacrificed her, though they had not the mind to do (it)."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And when you killed a man, then you disagreed with respect to that, and Allah was to bring forth that which you were going to hide."/>
		<aya index="73" text="So We said: Strike the (dead body) with part of the (Sacrificed cow), thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs so that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were like rocks, rather worse in hardness; and surely there are some rocks from which streams burst forth, and surely there are some of them which split asunder so water issues out of them, and surely there are some of them which fall down for fear of Allah, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this)."/>
		<aya index="76" text="And when they meet those who believe they say: We believe, and when they are alone one with another they say: Do you talk to them of what Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this before your Lord? Do you not then understand?"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And there are among them illiterates who know not the Book but only lies, and they do but conjecture."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Woe, then, to those who write the book with their hands and then say: This is from Allah, so that they may take for it a small price; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And they say: Fire shall not touch us but for a few days. Say: Have you received a promise from Allah, then Allah will not fail to perform His promise, or do you speak against Allah what you do not know?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Yea! whoever earns evil and his sins beset him on every side, these are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, these are the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall not serve any but Allah and (you shall do) good to (your) parents, and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then you turned back except a few of you and (now too) you turn aside."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a promise while you witnessed."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you would ransom them-- while their very turning out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other? What then is the re ward of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous chastisement, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="These are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter, so their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent apostles after him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! whenever then an apostle came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so Allah's curse is on the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have. Say: Why then did you kill Allah's Prophets before if you were indeed believers?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were unjust."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief. Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers."/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say: If the future abode with Allah is specially for you to the exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="95" text="And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before, and Allah knows the unjust."/>
		<aya index="96" text="And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement, and Allah sees what they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say: Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel-- for surely he revealed it to your heart by Allah's command, verifying that which is before it and guidance and good news for the believers."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="100" text="What! whenever they make a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? Nay, most of them do not believe."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And when there came to them an Apostle from Allah verifying that which they have, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing."/>
		<aya index="102" text="And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, &quot;Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever.&quot; Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah's permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls; had they but known this."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against evil), reward from Allah would certainly have been better; had they but known (this)."/>
		<aya index="104" text="O you who believe! do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen, and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not like, nor do the polytheists, that the good should be sent down to you from your Lord, and Allah chooses especially whom He pleases for His mercy, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have no guardian or helper?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Rather you wish to put questions to your Apostle, as Musa was questioned before; and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith, he indeed has lost the right direction of the way."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even) after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so that Allah should bring about His command; surely Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good you send before for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say: None shall enter the garden (or paradise) except he who is a Jew or a Christian. These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="112" text="Yes! whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is the doer of good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord, and there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so Allah shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men) from the masjids of Allah, that His name should be remembered in them, and strives to ruin them? (As for) these, it was not proper for them that they should have entered them except in fear; they shall meet with disgrace in this world, and they shall have great chastisement in the hereafter."/>
		<aya index="115" text="And Allah's is the East and the West, therefore, whither you turn, thither is Allah's purpose; surely Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And they say: Allah has taken to himself a son. Glory be to Him; rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His; all are obedient to Him."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, Be, so there it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said those before them, the like of what they say; their hearts are all alike. Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and you shall not be called upon to answer for the companions of the flaming fire."/>
		<aya index="120" text="And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians until you follow their religion. Say: Surely Allah's guidance, that is the (true) guidance. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have no guardian from Allah, nor any helper."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to be read. These believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it, these it is that are the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O children of Israel, call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And be on your guard against a day when no soul shall avail another in the least neither shall any compensation be accepted from it, nor shall intercession profit it, nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them. He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men. Ibrahim said: And of my offspring? My covenant does not include the unjust, said He."/>
		<aya index="125" text="And when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of) security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim. And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail saying: Purify My House for those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it) for devotion and those who bow down (and) those who prostrate themselves."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Ibrahim said: My Lord, make it a secure town and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the last day. He said: And whoever disbelieves, I will grant him enjoyment for a short while, then I will drive him to the chastisement of the fire; and it is an evil destination."/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House: Our Lord! accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing:"/>
		<aya index="128" text="Our Lord! and make us both submissive to Thee and (raise) from our offspring a nation submitting to Thee, and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us (mercifully), surely Thou art the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="129" text="Our Lord! and raise up in them an Apostle from among them who shall recite to them Thy communications and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and purify them; surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="130" text="And who forsakes the religion of Ibrahim but he who makes himself a fool, and most certainly We chose him in this world, and in the hereafter he is most surely among the righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="When his Lord said to him, Be a Muslim, he said: I submit myself to the Lord of the worlds."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and (so did) Yaqoub. O my sons! surely Allah has chosen for you (this) faith, therefore die not unless you are Muslims."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Nay! were you witnesses when death visited Yaqoub, when he said to his sons: What will you serve after me? They said: We will serve your God and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq, one God only, and to Him do we submit."/>
		<aya index="134" text="This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did."/>
		<aya index="135" text="And they say: Be Jews or Christians, you will be on the right course. Say: Nay! (we follow) the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not one of the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say: We believe in Allah and (in) that which had been revealed to us, and (in) that which was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and (in) that which was given to Musa and Isa, and (in) that which was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit."/>
		<aya index="137" text="If then they believe as you believe in Him, they are indeed on the right course, and if they turn back, then they are only in great opposition, so Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing."/>
		<aya index="138" text="(Receive) the baptism of Allah, and who is better than Allah in baptising? and Him do we serve."/>

When Ibrahim said: My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life and cause death.

So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him to life. He said: How long have you tarried? He said: I have tarried a day, or a part of a day. Said He: Nay! you have tarried a hundred years; then look at your food and drink-- years have not passed over it; and look at your ass; and that We may make you a sign to men, and look at the bones, how We set them together, then clothed them with flesh; so when it became clear to him, he said: I know that Allah has power over all things."/>

Remember My favor on you and on your mother, when I strengthened you I with the holy Spirit, you spoke to the people in the cradle and I when of old age, and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel; and when you determined out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I withheld the children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments, but those who disbelieved among them said: This is nothing but clear enchantment."/>

		<aya index="60" text="And He it is Who takes your souls at night (in sleep), and He knows what you acquire in the day, then He raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you were doing."/>

		<aya index="64" text="Say: Allah delivers you from them and from every distress, but again you set up others (with Him)."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Say: He has the power that He should send on you a chastisement from above you or from beneath your feet, or that He should throw you into confusion, (making you) of different parties; and make some of you taste the fighting of others.

		<aya index="66" text="And your people call it a lie and it is the very truth. Say: I am not placed in charge of you."/>
		<aya index="67" text="For every prophecy is a term, and you will come to know (it)."/>
		<aya index="68" text="And when you see those who enter into false discourses about Our communications, withdraw from them until they enter into some other discourse, and if the Shaitan causes you to forget, then do not sit after recollection with the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And nought of the reckoning of their (deeds) shall be against those who guard (against evil), but (theirs) is only to remind, haply they may guard."/>
		<aya index="70" text="And leave those who have taken their religion for a play and an idle sport, and whom this world's life has deceived, and remind (them) thereby lest a soul should be given up to destruction for what it has earned; it shall not have besides Allah any guardian nor an intercessor, and if it should seek to give every compensation, it shall not be accepted from it; these are they who shall be given up to destruction for what they earned; they shall have a drink of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Say: Shall we call on that besides Allah, which does not benefit us nor harm us, and shall we be returned back on our heels after Allah has guided us, like him whom the Shaitans have made to fall down perplexed in the earth?

		<aya index="74" text="And when Ibrahim said to his sire, Azar: Do you take idols for gods? Surely I see you and your people in manifest error."/>

		<aya index="79" text="Surely I have turned myself, being upright, wholly to Him Who originated the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And his people disputed with him. He said: Do you dispute with me respecting Allah? And He has guided me indeed; and I do not fear in any way those that you set up with Him, unless my Lord pleases; my Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge; will you not then mind?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="And how should I fear what you have set up (with Him), while you do not fear that you have set up with Allah that for which He has not sent down to you any authority; which then of the two parties is surer of security, if you know?"/>
		<aya index="82" text="Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with iniquity, those are they who shall have the security and they are those who go aright."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And this was Our argument which we gave to Ibrahim against his people; We exalt in dignity whom We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub; each did We guide, and Nuh did We guide before, and of his descendants, Dawood and Sulaiman and Ayub and Yusuf and Musa and Haroun; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others)."/>

		<aya index="88" text="This is Allah's guidance, He guides thereby whom He pleases of His servants; and if they had set up others (with Him), certainly what they did would have become ineffectual for them."/>
		<aya index="89" text="These are they to whom We gave the book and the wisdom and the prophecy; therefore if these disbelieve in it We have already entrusted with it a people who are not disbelievers in it."/>
		<aya index="90" text="These are they whom Allah guided, therefore follow their guidance. Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; it is nothing but a reminder to the nations."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And they do not assign to Allah the attributes due to Him when they say: Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal. Say: Who revealed the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to men, which you make into scattered writings which you show while you conceal much? And you were taught what you did not know, (neither) you nor your fathers. Say: Allah then leave them sporting in their vain discourses."/>
		<aya index="92" text="And this is a Book We have revealed, blessed, verifying that which is before it, and that you may warn the metropolis and those around her; and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it, and they attend to their prayers constantly."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or says: It has been revealed to me; while nothing has been revealed to him, and he who says: I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed? and if you had seen when the unjust shall be in the agonies of death and the angels shall spread forth their hands: Give up your souls; today shall you be recompensed with an ignominious chastisement because you spoke against Allah other than the truth and (because) you showed pride against His communications."/>
		<aya index="94" text="And certainly you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and you have left behind your backs the things which We gave you, and We do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted that they were (Allah's) associates in respect to you; certainly the ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted is gone from you."/>
		<aya index="95" text="Surely Allah causes the grain and the stone to germinate; He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer forth of the dead from the living; that is Allah! how are you then turned away."/>
		<aya index="96" text="He causes the dawn to break; and He has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for reckoning; this is an arrangement of the Mighty, the Knowing."/>
		<aya index="97" text="And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you might follow the right way thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea; truly We have made plain the communications for a people who know."/>
		<aya index="98" text="And He it is Who has brought you into being from a single soul, then there is (for you) a resting-place and a depository; indeed We have made plain the communications for a people who understand."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth with it buds of all (plants), then We bring forth from it green (foliage) from which We produce grain piled up (in the ear); and of the palm-tree, of the sheaths of it, come forth clusters (of dates) within reach, and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, alike and unlike; behold the fruit of it when it yields the fruit and the ripening of it; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe."/>
		<aya index="100" text="And they make the jinn associates with Allah, while He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without knowledge; glory be to Him, and highly exalted is He above what they ascribe (to Him)."/>

		<aya index="103" text="Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the Knower of subtleties, the Aware."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Indeed there have come to you clear proofs from your Lord; whoever will therefore see, it is for his own soul and whoever will be blind, it shall be against himself and I am not a keeper over you."/>
		<aya index="105" text="And thus do We repeat the communications and that they may say: You have read; and that We may make it clear to a people who know."/>

		<aya index="110" text="And We will turn their hearts and their sights, even as they did not believe in it the first time, and We will leave them in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead had spoken to them and We had brought together all things before them, they would not believe unless Allah pleases, but most of them are ignorant."/>
		<aya index="112" text="And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, the Shaitans from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive (them), and had your Lord pleased they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge."/>

		<aya index="118" text="Therefore eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned if you are believers in His communications."/>
		<aya index="119" text="And what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned, and He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden to you-- excepting what you are compelled to; and most surely many would lead (people) astray by their low desires out of ignorance; surely your Lord-- He best knows those who exceed the limits."/>
		<aya index="120" text="And abandon open and secret sin; surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned."/>
		<aya index="121" text="And do not eat of that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned, and that is most surely a transgression; and most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should contend with you; and if you obey them, you shall most surely be polytheists."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And thus have We made in every town the great ones to be its guilty ones, that they may plan therein; and they do not plan but against their own souls, and they do not perceive."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And when a communication comes to them they say: We will not believe till we are given the like of what Allah's apostles are given. Allah best knows where He places His message. There shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from Allah and severe chastisement because of what they planned."/>
		<aya index="125" text="Therefore (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And this is the path of your Lord, (a) right (path); indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who mind."/>
		<aya index="127" text="They shall have the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is their guardian because of what they did."/>
		<aya index="128" text="And on the day when He shall gather them all together: O assembly of jinn! you took away a great part of mankind. And their friends from among the men shall say: Our Lord! some of us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which Thou didst appoint for us. He shall say: The fire is your abode, to abide in it, except as Allah is pleased; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing."/>
		<aya index="129" text="And thus do We make some of the iniquitous to befriend others on account of what they earned."/>
		<aya index="130" text="O assembly of jinn and men! did there not come to you apostles from among you, relating to you My communications and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours? They shall say: We bear witness against ourselves; and this world's life deceived them, and they shall bear witness against their own souls that they were unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="131" text="This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were negligent."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And all have degrees according to what they do; and your Lord is not heedless of what they do."/>
		<aya index="133" text="And your Lord is the Self-sufficient one, the Lord of mercy; if He pleases, He may take you off, and make whom He pleases successors after you, even as He raised you up from the seed of another people."/>
		<aya index="134" text="Surely what you are threatened with must come to pass and you cannot escape (it)."/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say: O my people! act according to your ability; I too am acting; so you will soon come to know, for whom (of us) will be the (good) end of the abode; surely the unjust shall not be successful."/>
		<aya index="136" text="And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has created of tilth and cattle, and say: This is for Allah-- so they assert-- and this for our associates; then what is for their associates, it reaches not to Allah, and whatever is (set apart) for Allah, it reaches to their associates; evil is that which they judge."/>
		<aya index="137" text="And thus their associates have made fair seeming to most of the polytheists the killing of their children, that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion; and if Allah had pleased, they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge."/>
		<aya index="138" text="And they say: These are cattle and tilth prohibited, none shall eat them except such as We please-- so they assert-- and cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle on which they would not mention Allah's name-- forging a lie against Him; He shall requite them for what they forged."/>
		<aya index="139" text="And they say: What is in the wombs of these cattle is specially for our males, and forbidden to our wives, and if it be stillborn, then they are all partners in it; He will reward them for their attributing (falsehood to Allah); surely He is Wise, Knowing."/>
		<aya index="140" text="They are lost indeed who kill their children foolishly without knowledge, and forbid what Allah has given to them forging a lie against Allah; they have indeed gone astray, and they are not the followers of the right course."/>
		<aya index="141" text="And He it is Who produces gardens (of vine), trellised and untrellised, and palms and seed-produce of which the fruits are of various sorts, and olives and pomegranates, like and unlike; eat of its fruit when it bears fruit, and pay the due of it on the day of its reaping, and do not act extravagantly; surely He does not love the extravagant."/>
		<aya index="142" text="And of cattle (He created) beasts of burden and those which are fit for slaughter only; eat of what Allah has given you and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy."/>
		<aya index="143" text="Eight in pairs-- two of sheep and two of goats. Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="144" text="And two of camels and two of cows. Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when Allah enjoined you this? Who, then, is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah that he should lead astray men without knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="145" text="Say: I do not find in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden for an eater to eat of except that it be what has died of itself, or blood poured forth, or flesh of swine-- for that surely is unclean-- or that which is a transgression, other than (the name of) Allah having been invoked on it; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."/>
		<aya index="146" text="And to those who were Jews We made unlawful every animal having claws, and of oxen and sheep We made unlawful to them the fat of both, except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with bones: this was a punishment We gave them on account of their rebellion, and We are surely Truthful."/>
		<aya index="147" text="But if they give you the lie, then say: Your Lord is the Lord of All-encompassing mercy; and His punishment cannot be averted from the guilty people."/>
		<aya index="148" text="Those who are polytheists will say: If Allah had pleased we would not have associated (aught with Him) nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden (to ourselves) anything; even so did those before them reject until they tasted Our punishment. Say: Have you any knowledge with you so you should bring it forth to us? You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies."/>
		<aya index="149" text="Say: Then Allah's is the conclusive argument; so if He please, He would certainly guide you all."/>
		<aya index="150" text="Say: Bring your witnesses who should bear witness that Allah has forbidden this, then if they bear witness, do not bear witness with them; and follow not the low desires of those who reject Our communications and of those who do not believe in the hereafter, and they make (others) equal to their Lord."/>
		<aya index="151" text="Say: Come I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you-- (remember) that you do not associate anything with Him and show kindness to your parents, and do not slay your children for (fear of) poverty-- We provide for you and for them-- and do not draw nigh to indecencies, those of them which are apparent and those which are concealed, and do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except for the requirements of justice; this He has enjoined you with that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="152" text="And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner until he attains his maturity, and give full measure and weight with justice-- We do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability; and when you speak, then be just though it be (against) a relative, and fulfill Allah's covenant; this He has enjoined you with that you may be mindful;"/>
		<aya index="153" text="And (know) that this is My path, the right one therefore follow it, and follow not (other) ways, for they will lead you away from His way; this He has enjoined you with that you may guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="154" text="Again, We gave the Book to Musa to complete (Our blessings) on him who would do good (to others), and making plain all things and a guidance and a mercy, so that they should believe in the meeting of their Lord."/>
		<aya index="155" text="And this is a Book We have revealed, blessed; therefore follow it and guard (against evil) that mercy may be shown to you."/>
		<aya index="156" text="Lest you say that the Book was only revealed to two parties before us and We were truly unaware of what they read."/>
		<aya index="157" text="Or lest you should say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would certainly have been better guided than they, so indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah's communications and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our communications with an evil chastisement because they turned away."/>
		<aya index="158" text="They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. Say: Wait; we too are waiting."/>
		<aya index="159" text="Surely they who divided their religion into parts and became sects, you have no concern with them; their affair is only with Allah, then He will inform them of what they did."/>
		<aya index="160" text="Whoever brings a good deed, he shall have ten like it, and whoever brings an evil deed, he shall be recompensed only with the like of it, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly."/>
		<aya index="161" text="Say: Surely, (as for) me, my Lord has guided me to the right path; (to) a most right religion, the faith of Ibrahim the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="162" text="Say. Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds;"/>
		<aya index="163" text="No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit."/>
		<aya index="164" text="Say: What! shall I seek a Lord other than Allah? And He is the Lord of all things; and no soul earns (evil) but against itself, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed."/>
		<aya index="165" text="And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and raised some of you above others by (various) grades, that He might try you by what He has given you; surely your Lord is quick to requite (evil), and He is most surely the Forgiving, the Merciful."/>

		<aya index="72" text="So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from Us, and We cut off the last of those who rejected Our communications and were not believers."/>
		<aya index="73" text="And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord; this is (as) Allah's she-camel for you-- a sign, therefore leave her alone to pasture on Allah's earth, and do not touch her with any harm, otherwise painful chastisement will overtake you."/>
		<aya index="74" text="And remember when He made you successors after Ad and settled you in the land-- you make mansions on its plains and hew out houses in the mountains-- remember therefore Allah's benefits and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief."/>

		<aya index="79" text="Then he turned away from them and said: O my people I did certainly deliver to you the message of my Lord, and I gave you good advice, but you do not love those who give good advice."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people: What! do you commit an indecency which any one in the world has not done before you?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Most surely you come to males in lust besides females; nay you are an extravagant people."/>

		<aya index="84" text="And We rained upon them a rain; consider then what was the end of the guilty."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord, therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to men their things, and do not make mischief in the land after its reform; this is better for you if you are believers:"/>

		<aya index="103" text="Then we raised after them Musa with Our communications to Firon and his chiefs, but they disbelieved in them; consider then what was the end of the mischief makers."/>

		<aya index="138" text="And We made the children of Israel to pass the sea; then they came upon a people who kept to the worship of their idols They said: O Musa! make for us a god as they have (their) gods He said: Surely you are a people acting ignorantly:"/>

		<aya index="150" text="And when Musa returned to his people, wrathful (and) in violent grief, he said: Evil is it that you have done after me; did you turn away from the bidding of your Lord? And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. He said: Son of my mother! surely the people reckoned me weak and had well-nigh slain me, therefore make not the enemies to rejoice over me and count me not among the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="151" text="He said: My Lord! forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful ones."/>

		<aya index="154" text="And when Musa's anger calmed down he took up the tablets, and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for those who fear for the sake of their Lord."/>
		<aya index="155" text="And Musa chose out of his people seventy men for Our appointment; so when the earthquake overtook them, he said: My Lord! if Thou hadst pleased, Thou hadst destroyed them before and myself (too); wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools among us have done? It is naught but Thy trial, Thou makest err with it whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest: Thou art our Guardian, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the forgivers."/>
		<aya index="156" text="And ordain for us good in this world's life and in the hereafter, for surely we turn to Thee.

		<aya index="159" text="And of Musa's people was a party who guided (people) with the truth, and thereby did they do justice."/>
		<aya index="160" text="And We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for water: Strike the rock with your staff, so outnowed from it twelve springs; each tribe knew its drinking place; and We made the clouds to give shade over them and We sent to them manna and quails: Eat of the good things We have given you. And they did not do Us any harm, but they did injustice to their own souls."/>
		<aya index="161" text="And when it was said to them: Reside in this town and eat from it wherever you wish, and say, Put down from us our heavy burdens: and enter the gate making obeisance, We will forgive you your wrongs: We will give more to those who do good (to others)."/>
		<aya index="162" text="But those who were unjust among them changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them; so We sent upon them a pestilence from heaven because they were unjust."/>
		<aya index="163" text="And ask them about the town which stood by the sea; when they exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on the day of their Sabbath, appearing on the surface of the water, and on the day on which they did not keep the Sabbath they did not come to them; thus did We try them because they transgressed."/>
		<aya index="164" text="And when a party of them said: Why do you admonish a with a severe chastisement? They said: To be free from blame before your Lord, and that haply they may guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="165" text="So when they neglected what they had been reminded of, We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who were unjust with an evil chastisement because they transgressed."/>

		<aya index="169" text="Then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited the Book, taking only the frail good of this low life and saying: It will be forgiven us.

		<aya index="14" text="But if they do not answer you, then know that it is revealed by Allah's knowledge and that there is no god but He; will you then submit?"/>

		<aya index="16" text="These are they for whom there is nothing but fire in the hereafter, and what they wrought in it shall go for nothing, and vain is what they do."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it and before it (is) the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it; and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, surely it is the truth from your Lord, but most men do not believe."/>
		<aya index="18" text="And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? These shall be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say: These are they who lied against their Lord. Now surely the curse of Allah is on the unjust."/>

		<aya index="22" text="Truly in the hereafter they are the greatest losers."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Surely (as to) those who believe and do good and humble themselves to their Lord, these are the dwellers of the garden, in it they will abide."/>
		<aya index="24" text="The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seeing and the hearing: are they equal in condition? Will you not then mind?"/>
		<aya index="25" text="And certainly We sent Nuh to his people: Surely I am a plain warner for you:"/>
		<aya index="26" text="That you shall not serve any but Allah, surely I fear for you the punishment of a painful day."/>
		<aya index="27" text="But the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: We do not consider you but a mortal like ourselves, and we do not see any have followed you but those who are the meanest of us at first thought and we do not see in you any excellence over us; nay, we deem you liars."/>
		<aya index="28" text="He said: O my people! tell me if I have with me clear proof from my Lord, and He has granted me mercy from Himself and it has been made obscure to you; shall we constrain you to (accept) it while you are averse from it?"/>
		<aya index="29" text="And, O my people! I ask you not for wealth in return for it; my reward is only with Allah and I am not going to drive away those who believe; surely they shall meet their Lord, but I consider you a people who are ignorant:"/>

		<aya index="31" text="And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah and I do not know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say about those whom your eyes hold in mean estimation (that) Allah will never grant them (any) good-- Allah knows best what is in their souls-- for then most surely I should be of the unjust."/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said: O Nuh! indeed you have disputed with us and lengthened dispute with us, therefore bring to us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: Allah only will bring it to you if He please, and you will not escape:"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And if I intend to give you good advice, my advice will not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you to go astray; He is your Lord, and to Him shall you be returned."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: If I have forged it, on me is my guilt, and I am clear of that of which you are guilty."/>
		<aya index="36" text="And it was revealed to Nuh: That none of your people will believe except those who have already believed, therefore do not grieve at what they do:"/>
		<aya index="37" text="And make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation, and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall be drowned."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And he began to make the ark; and whenever the chiefs from among his people passed by him they laughed at him. He said: If you laugh at us, surely we too laugh at you as you laugh (at us)."/>
		<aya index="39" text="So shall you know who it is on whom will come a chastisement which will disgrace him, and on whom will lasting chastisement come down."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Until when Our command came and water came forth from the valley, We said: Carry in it two of all things, a pair, and your own family-- except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and those who believe. And there believed not with him but a few."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And he said: Embark in it, in the name of Allah be its sailing and its anchoring; most surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And it moved on with them amid waves like mountains; and Nuh called out to his son, and he was aloof: O my son! embark with us and be not with the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="43" text="He said: I will betake myself for refuge to a mountain that shall protect me from the water. Nuh said: There is no protector today from Allah's punishment but He Who has mercy; and a wave intervened between them, so he was of the drowned."/>
		<aya index="44" text="And it was said: O earth, swallow down your water, and O cloud, clear away; and the water was made to abate and the affair was decided, and the ark rested on the Judi, and it was said: Away with the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And Nuh cried out to his Lord and said: My Lord! surely my son is of my family, and Thy promise is surely true, and Thou art the most just of the judges."/>
		<aya index="46" text="He said: O Nuh! surely he is not of your family; surely he is (the doer of) other than good deeds, therefore ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge; surely I admonish you lest you may be of the ignorant"/>
		<aya index="47" text="He said: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from asking Thee that of which I have no knowledge; and if Thou shouldst not forgive me and have mercy on me, I should be of the losers."/>
		<aya index="48" text="It was said: O Nuh! descend with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people from among those who are with you, and there shall be nations whom We will afford provisions, then a painful punishment from Us shall afflict them."/>
		<aya index="49" text="These are announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you, you did not know them-- (neither) you nor your people-- before this; therefore be patient; surely the end is for those who guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than He; you are nothing but forgers (of lies)."/>
		<aya index="51" text="O my people! I do not ask of you any reward for it; my reward is only with Him Who created me; do you not then understand?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="And, O my people! ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; He will send on you clouds pouring down abundance of rain and add strength to your strength, and do not turn back guilty."/>
		<aya index="53" text="They said: O Hud! you have not brought to us any clear argument and we are not going to desert our gods for your word, and we are not believers in you:"/>
		<aya index="54" text="We cannot say aught but that some of our gods have smitten you with evil. He said: Surely I call Allah to witness, and do you bear witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (with Allah)."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Besides Him, therefore scheme against me all together; then give me no respite:"/>
		<aya index="56" text="Surely I rely on Allah, my Lord and your Lord; there is no living creature but He holds it by its forelock; surely my Lord is on the right path."/>
		<aya index="57" text="But if you turn back, then indeed I have delivered to you the message with which I have been sent to you, and my Lord will bring another people in your place, and you cannot do Him any harm; surely my Lord is the Preserver of all things."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Hud and those who believed with him with mercy from Us, and We delivered them from a hard chastisement."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And this was Ad; they denied the communications of their Lord, and disobeyed His apostles and followed the bidding of every insolent opposer (of truth)."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And they were overtaken by curse in this world and on the resurrection day; now surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord; now surely, away with Ad, the people of Hud."/>
		<aya index="61" text="And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than He; He brought you into being from the earth, and made you dwell in it, therefore ask forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Nigh, Answering."/>
		<aya index="62" text="They said: O Salih! surely you were one amongst us in whom great expectations were placed before this; do you (now) forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped? And as to that which you call us to, most surely we are in disquieting doubt."/>
		<aya index="63" text="He said: O my people! tell me if I have clear proof from my Lord and He has granted to me mercy from Himself-- who will then help me against Allah if I disobey Him? Therefore you do not add to me other than loss:"/>
		<aya index="64" text="And, O my people! this will be (as) Allah's she-camel for you, a sign; therefore leave her to pasture on Allah's earth and do not touch her with evil, for then a near chastisement will overtake you."/>
		<aya index="65" text="But they slew her, so he said: Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days, that is a promise not to be belied."/>
		<aya index="66" text="So when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Salih and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and (We saved them) from the disgrace of that day; surely your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And the rumbling overtook those who were unjust, so they became motionless bodies in their abodes,"/>
		<aya index="68" text="As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely did Samood disbelieve in their Lord; now surely, away with Samood."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And certainly Our apostles came to Ibrahim with good news. They said: Peace. Peace, said he, and he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf."/>
		<aya index="70" text="But when he saw that their hands were not extended towards it, he deemed them strange and conceived fear of them. They said: Fear not, surely we are sent to Lut's people."/>
		<aya index="71" text="And his wife was standing (by), so she laughed, then We gave her the good news of Ishaq and after Ishaq of (a son's son) Yaqoub."/>
		<aya index="72" text="She said: O wonder! shall I bear a son when I am an extremely old woman and this my husband an extremely old man? Most surely this is a wonderful thing."/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said: Do you wonder at Allah's bidding? The mercy of Allah and His blessings are on you, O people of the house, surely He is Praised, Glorious."/>
		<aya index="74" text="So when fear had gone away from Ibrahim and good news came to him, he began to plead with Us for Lut's people."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Most surely Ibrahim was forbearing, tender-hearted, oft-returning (to Allah):"/>
		<aya index="76" text="O Ibrahim! leave off this, surely the decree of your Lord has come to pass, and surely there must come to them a chastisement that cannot be averted."/>
		<aya index="77" text="And when Our apostles came to Lut, he was grieved for them, and he lacked strength to protect them, and said: This is a hard day."/>
		<aya index="78" text="And his people came to him, (as if) rushed on towards him, and already they did evil deeds. He said: O my people! these are my daughters-- they are purer for you, so guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests; is there not among you one right-minded man?"/>
		<aya index="79" text="They said: Certainly you know that we have no claim on your daughters, and most surely you know what we desire."/>
		<aya index="80" text="He said: Ah! that I had power to suppress you, rather I shall have recourse to a strong support."/>
		<aya index="81" text="They said: O Lut! we are the apostles of your Lord; they shall by no means reach you; so remove your followers in a part of the night-- and let none of you turn back-- except your wife, for surely whatsoever befalls them shall befall her; surely their appointed time is the morning; is not the morning nigh?"/>
		<aya index="82" text="So when Our decree came to pass, We turned them upside down and rained down upon them stones, of what had been decreed, one after another."/>
		<aya index="83" text="Marked (for punishment) with your Lord and it is not far off from the unjust."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than He, and do not give short measure and weight: surely I see you in prosperity and surely I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing day."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And, O my people! give full measure and weight fairly, and defraud not men their things, and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief:"/>
		<aya index="86" text="What remains with Allah is better for you if you are believers, and I am not a keeper over you."/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: O Shu'aib! does your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property? Forsooth you are the forbearing, the right-directing one."/>
		<aya index="88" text="He said: O my people! have you considered if I have a clear proof from my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself, and I do not desire that in opposition to you I should betake myself to that which I forbid you: I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able, and with none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue; on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn:"/>
		<aya index="89" text="And, O my people! let not opposition to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell the people of Nuh, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Merciful, Loving-kind."/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: O Shu'aib! we do not understand much of what you say and most surely we see you to be weak among us, and were it not for your family we would surely stone you, and you are not mighty against us."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said: O my people! is my family more esteemed by you than Allah? And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your back; surely my Lord encompasses what you do:"/>
		<aya index="93" text="And, O my people! act according to your ability, I too am acting; you will come to know soon who it is on whom will light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is that is a liar, and watch, surely I too am watching with you."/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Shu'aib, and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless bodies in their abodes,"/>
		<aya index="95" text="As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely perdition overtook Madyan as had perished Samood."/>
		<aya index="96" text="And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and a clear authority,"/>
		<aya index="97" text="To Firon and his chiefs, but they followed the bidding of Firon, and Firon's bidding was not right-directing."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He shall lead his people on the resurrection day, and bring them down to the fire; and evil the place to which they are brought."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And they are overtaken by curse in this (world), and on the resurrection day, evil the gift which shall be given."/>
		<aya index="100" text="This is an account of (the fate of) the towns which We relate to you; of them are some that stand and (others) mown down."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And We did not do them injustice, but they were unjust to themselves, so their gods whom they called upon besides Allah did not avail them aught when the decree of your Lord came to pass; and they added but to their ruin."/>
		<aya index="102" text="And such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are unjust; surely His punishment is painful, severe."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Most surely there is a sign in this for him who fears the chastisement of the hereafter; this is a day on which the people shall be gathered together and this is a day that shall be witnessed."/>
		<aya index="104" text="And We do not delay it but to an appointed term."/>
		<aya index="105" text="On the day when it shall come, no soul shall speak except with His permission, then (some) of them shall be unhappy and (others) happy."/>
		<aya index="106" text="So as to those who are unhappy, they shall be in the fire; for them shall be sighing and groaning in it:"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; surely your Lord is the mighty doer of what He intends."/>
		<aya index="108" text="And as to those who are made happy, they shall be in the garden, abiding in it as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; a gift which shall never be cut off."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Therefore be not in doubt as to what these worship; they do not worship but as their fathers worshipped before; and most surely We will pay them back in full their portion undiminished."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And certainly We gave the book to Musa, but it was gone against; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord, the matter would surely have been decided between them; and surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And your Lord will most surely pay back to all their deeds in full; surely He is aware of what they do."/>
		<aya index="112" text="Continue then in the right way as you are commanded, as also he who has turned (to Allah) with you, and be not inordinate (O men!), surely He sees what you do."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And do not incline to those who are unjust, lest the fire touch you, and you have no guardians besides Allah, then you shall not be helped."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And keep up prayer in the two parts of the day and in the first hours of the night; surely good deeds take away evil deeds this is a reminder to the mindful."/>
		<aya index="115" text="And be patient, for surely Allah does not waste the reward of the good-doers."/>
		<aya index="116" text="But why were there not among the generations before you those possessing understanding, who should have forbidden the making of mischief in the earth, except a few of those whom We delivered from among them? And those who were unjust went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty, and they were guilty."/>
		<aya index="117" text="And it did not beseem your Lord to have destroyed the towns tyrannously, while their people acted well."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And if your Lord had pleased He would certainly have made people a single nation, and they shall continue to differ."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Except those on whom your Lord has mercy; and for this did He create them; and the word of your Lord is fulfilled: Certainly I will fill hell with the jinn and the men, all together."/>
		<aya index="120" text="And all we relate to you of the accounts of the apostles is to strengthen your heart therewith; and in this has come to you the truth and an admonition, and a reminder to the believers."/>
		<aya index="121" text="And say to those who do not believe: Act according to your state; surely we too are acting."/>
		<aya index="122" text="And wait; surely we are waiting also."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And Allah's is the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is returned the whole of the affair; therefore serve Him and rely on Him, and your Lord is not heedless of what you do."/>

		<aya index="3" text="We narrate to you the best of narratives, by Our revealing to you this Quran, though before this you were certainly one of those who did not know."/>
		<aya index="4" text="When Yusuf said to his father: O my father! surely I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon-- I saw them making obeisance to me."/>
		<aya index="5" text="He said: O my son! do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they devise a plan against you; surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man."/>
		<aya index="6" text="And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of sayings and make His favor complete to you and to the children of Yaqoub, as He made it complete before to your fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq; surely your Lord is Knowing, Wise."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Certainly in Yusuf and his brothers there are signs for the inquirers."/>
		<aya index="8" text="When they said: Certainly Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we, though we are a (stronger) company; most surely our father is in manifest error:"/>
		<aya index="9" text="Slay Yusuf or cast him (forth) into some land, so that your father's regard may be exclusively for you, and after that you may be a righteous people."/>
		<aya index="10" text="A speaker from among them said: Do not slay Yusuf, and cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do (it), (so that) some of the travellers may pick him up."/>
		<aya index="11" text="They said: O our father! what reason have you that you do not trust in us with respect to Yusuf? And most surely we are his sincere well-wishers:"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport, and surely we will guard him well."/>
		<aya index="13" text="He said: Surely it grieves me that you should take him off, and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him."/>
		<aya index="14" text="They said: Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a (strong) company, we should then certainly be losers."/>
		<aya index="15" text="So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of the pit, and We revealed to him: You will most certainly inform them of this their affair while they do not perceive."/>
		<aya index="16" text="And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They said: O our father! surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods, so the wolf devoured him, and you will not believe us though we are truthful."/>
		<aya index="18" text="And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, your souls have made the matter light for you, but patience is good and Allah is He Whose help is sought for against what you describe."/>
		<aya index="19" text="And there came travellers and they sent their water-drawer and he let down his bucket. He said: O good news! this is a youth; and they concealed him as an article of merchandise, and Allah knew what they did."/>
		<aya index="20" text="And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces of silver, and they showed no desire for him."/>
		<aya index="21" text="And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Give him an honorable abode, maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings; and Allah is the master of His affair, but most people do not know."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he had attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge: and thus do We reward those who do good."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And she in whose house he was sought to make himself yield (to her), and she made fast the doors and said: Come forward. He said: I seek Allah's refuge, surely my Lord made good my abode: Surely the unjust do not prosper."/>
		<aya index="24" text="And certainly she made for him, and he would have made for her, were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence of his Lord; thus (it was) that We might turn away from him evil and indecency, surely he was one of Our sincere servants."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And they both hastened to the door, and she rent his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door. She said: What is the punishment of him who intends evil to your wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement?"/>
		<aya index="26" text="He said: She sought to make me yield (to her); and a witness of her own family bore witness: If his shirt is rent from front, she speaks the truth and he is one of the liars:"/>
		<aya index="27" text="And if his shirt is rent from behind, she tells a lie and he is one of the truthful."/>
		<aya index="28" text="So when he saw his shirt rent from behind, he said: Surely it is a guile of you women; surely your guile is great:"/>
		<aya index="29" text="O Yusuf! turn aside from this; and (O my wife)! ask forgiveness for your fault, surely you are one of the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And women in the city said: The chiefs wife seeks her slave to yield himself (to her), surely he has affected her deeply with (his) love; most surely we see her in manifest error."/>
		<aya index="31" text="So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them a repast, and gave each of them a knife, and said (to Yusuf): Come forth to them. So when they saw him, they deemed him great, and cut their hands (in amazement), and said: Remote is Allah (from imperfection); this is not a mortal; this is but a noble angel."/>
		<aya index="32" text="She said: This is he with respect to whom you blamed me, and certainly I sought his yielding himself (to me), but he abstained, and if he does not do what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be of those who are in a state of ignominy."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: My Lord! the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite me; and if Thou turn not away their device from me, I will yearn towards them and become (one) of the ignorant."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him till a time."/>
		<aya index="36" text="And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them said: I saw myself pressing wine. And the other said: I saw myself carrying bread on my head, of which birds ate. Inform us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be of the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="37" text="He said: There shall not come to you the food with which you are fed, but I will inform you both of its interpretation before it comes to you; this is of what my Lord has taught me; surely I have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they are deniers of the hereafter:"/>
		<aya index="38" text="And I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub; it beseems us not that we should associate aught with Allah; this is by Allah's grace upon us and on mankind, but most people do not give thanks:"/>
		<aya index="39" text="O my two mates of the prison! are sundry lords better or Allah the One, the Supreme?"/>
		<aya index="40" text="You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent down any authority for them; judgment is only Allah's; He has commanded that you shall not serve aught but Him; this is the right religion but most people do not know:"/>
		<aya index="41" text="O my two mates of the prison! as for one of you, he shall give his lord to drink wine; and as for the other, he shall be crucified, so that the birds shall eat from his head, the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two: Remember me with your lord; but the Shaitan caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so he remained in the prison a few years."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And the king said: Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream."/>
		<aya index="44" text="They said: Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And of the two (prisoners) he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long time said: I will inform you of its interpretation, so let me go:"/>

		<aya index="50" text="And the king said: Bring him to me. So when the messenger came to him, he said: Go back to your lord and ask him, what is the case of the women who cut their hands; surely my Lord knows their guile."/>
		<aya index="51" text="He said: How was your affair when you sought Yusuf to yield himself (to you)? They said: Remote is Allah (from imperfection), we knew of no evil on his part. The chief's wife said: Now has the truth become established: I sought him to yield himself (to me), and he is most surely of the truthful ones."/>
		<aya index="52" text="This is that he might know that I have not been unfaithful to him in secret and that Allah does not guide the device of the unfaithful."/>

		<aya index="55" text="He said: Place me (in authority) over the treasures of the land, surely I am a good keeper, knowing well."/>
		<aya index="56" text="And thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land-- he had mastery in it wherever he liked; We send down Our mercy on whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of those who do good."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better for those who believe and guard (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And Yusuf's brothers came and went in to him, and he knew them, while they did not recognize him."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And when he furnished them with their provision, he said: Bring to me a brother of yours from your father; do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of hosts?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="But if you do not bring him to me, you shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you come near me."/>
		<aya index="61" text="They said: We will strive to make his father yield in respect of him, and we are sure to do (it)."/>
		<aya index="62" text="And he said to his servants: Put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when they go back to their family, so that they may come back."/>
		<aya index="63" text="So when they returned to their father, they said: O our father, the measure is withheld from us, therefore send with us our brother, (so that) we may get the measure, and we will most surely guard him."/>
		<aya index="64" text="He said: I cannot trust in you with respect to him, except as I trusted in you with respect to his brother before; but Allah is the best Keeper, and He is the most Merciful of the merciful ones."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And when they opened their goods, they found their money returned to them. They said: O our father! what (more) can we desire? This is our property returned to us, and we will bring corn for our family and guard our brother, and will have in addition the measure of a camel (load); this is an easy measure."/>
		<aya index="66" text="He said: I will by no means send him with you until you give me a firm covenant in Allah's name that you will most certainly bring him back to me, unless you are completely surrounded. And when they gave him their covenant, he said: Allah is the One in Whom trust is placed as regards what we say."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And he said: O my sons! do not (all) enter by one gate and enter by different gates and I cannot avail you aught against Allah; judgment is only Allah's; on Him do I rely, and on Him let those who are reliant rely."/>
		<aya index="68" text="And when they had entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avail them aught against Allah, but (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied; and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most people do not know."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And when they went in to Yusuf. he lodged his brother with himself, saying: I am your brother, therefore grieve not at what they do."/>
		<aya index="70" text="So when he furnished them with their provisions, (someone) placed the drinking cup in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried out: O caravan! you are most surely thieves."/>
		<aya index="71" text="They said while they were facing them: What is it that you miss?"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They said: We miss the king's drinking cup, and he who shall bring it shall have a camel-load and I am responsible for it."/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said: By Allah! you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves."/>
		<aya index="74" text="They said: But what shall be the requital of this, if you are liars?"/>
		<aya index="75" text="They said: The requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself be (held for) the satisfaction thereof; thus do we punish the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="76" text="So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, then he brought it out from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf; it was not (lawful) that he should take his brother under the king's law unless Allah pleased; We raise the degrees of whomsoever We please, and above every one possessed of knowledge is the All-knowing one."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They said: If he steal, a brother of his did indeed steal before; but Yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them. He said: You are in an evil condition and Allah knows best what you state."/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said: O chief! he has a father, a very old man, therefore retain one of us in his stead; surely we see you to be of the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="79" text="He said: Allah protect us that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property, for then most surely we would be unjust."/>
		<aya index="80" text="Then when they despaired of him, they retired, conferring privately together. The eldest of them said: Do you not know that your father took from you a covenant in Allah's name, and how you fell short of your duty with respect to Yusuf before? Therefore I will by no means depart from this land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of the judges:"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Go back to your father and say: O our father! surely your son committed theft, and we do not bear witness except to what we have known, and we could not keep watch over the unseen:"/>
		<aya index="82" text="And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded, and most surely we are truthful."/>
		<aya index="83" text="He (Yaqoub) said: Nay, your souls have made a matter light for you, so patience is good; maybe Allah will bring them all together to me; surely He is the Knowing, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And he turned away from them, and said: O my sorrow for Yusuf! and his eyes became white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor (of grief)."/>
		<aya index="85" text="They said: By Allah! you will not cease to remember Yusuf until you are a prey to constant disease or (until) you are of those who perish."/>
		<aya index="86" text="He said: I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know."/>
		<aya index="87" text="O my sons! Go and inquire respecting Yusuf and his brother, and despair not of Allah's mercy; surely none despairs of Allah's mercy except the unbelieving people."/>
		<aya index="88" text="So when they came in to him, they said: O chief! distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought scanty money, so give us full measure and be charitable to us; surely Allah rewards the charitable."/>
		<aya index="89" text="He said: Do you know how you treated Yusuf and his brother when you were ignorant?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They said: Are you indeed Yusuf? He said: I am Yusuf and this is my brother; Allah has indeed been gracious to us; surely he who guards (against evil) and is patient (is rewarded) for surely Allah does not waste the reward of those who do good."/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: By Allah! now has Allah certainly chosen you over us, and we were certainly sinners."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said: (There shall be) no reproof against you this day; Allah may forgive you, and He is the most Merciful of the merciful."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Take this my shirt and cast it on my father's face, he will (again) be able to see, and come to me with all your families."/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when the caravan had departed, their father said: Most surely I perceive the greatness of Yusuf, unless you pronounce me to be weak in judgment."/>
		<aya index="95" text="They said: By Allah, you are most surely in your old error."/>
		<aya index="96" text="So when the bearer of good news came he cast it on his face, so forthwith he regained his sight. He said: Did I not say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know?"/>
		<aya index="97" text="They said: O our father! ask forgiveness of our faults for us, surely we were sinners."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said: I will ask for you forgiveness from my Lord; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Then when they came in to Yusuf, he took his parents to lodge with him and said: Enter safe into Egypt, if Allah please."/>
		<aya index="100" text="And he raised his parents upon the throne and they fell down in prostration before him, and he said: O my father! this is the significance of my vision of old; my Lord has indeed made it to be true; and He was indeed kind to me when He brought me forth from the prison and brought you from the desert after the Shaitan had sown dissensions between me and my brothers, surely my Lord is benignant to whom He pleases; surely He is the Knowing, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="101" text="My Lord! Thou hast given me of the kingdom and taught me of the interpretation of sayings: Originator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my guardian in this world and the hereafter; make me die a muslim and join me with the good."/>
		<aya index="102" text="This is of the announcements relating to the unseen (which) We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they resolved upon their affair, and they were devising plans."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly."/>
		<aya index="104" text="And you do not ask them for a reward for this; it is nothing but a reminder for all mankind."/>
		<aya index="105" text="And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth which they pass by, yet they turn aside from it."/>
		<aya index="106" text="And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others (with Him)."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do they then feel secure that there may come to them an extensive chastisement from Allah or (that) the hour may come to them suddenly while they do not perceive?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Say: This is my way: I call to Allah, I and those who follow me being certain, and glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="109" text="And We have not sent before you but men from (among) the people of the towns, to whom We sent revelations. Have they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who guard (against evil); do you not then understand?"/>
		<aya index="110" text="Until when the apostles despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told a lie, Our help came to them and whom We pleased was delivered; and Our punishment is not averted from the guilty people."/>
		<aya index="111" text="In their histories there is certainly a lesson for men of understanding. It is not a narrative which could be forged, but a verification of what is before it and a distinct explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe."/>

		<aya index="38" text="But as for me, He, Allah, is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord."/>
		<aya index="39" text="And wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden: It is as Allah has pleased, there is no power save in Allah? If you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and children,"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Then maybe my Lord will give me what is better than your garden, and send on it a thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall become even ground without plant,"/>

		<aya index="42" text="And his wealth was destroyed; so he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, while it lay, having fallen down upon its roofs, and he said: Ah me! would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord."/>

		<aya index="44" text="Here is protection only Allah's, the True One; He is best in (the giving of) reward and best in requiting."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And set forth to them parable of the life of this world: like water which We send down from the cloud so the herbage of the earth becomes tangled on account of it, then it becomes dry broken into pieces which the winds scatter; and Allah is the holder of power over all things."/>

		<aya index="50" text="And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam; they made obeisance but Iblis (did it not). He was of the jinn, so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord. What! would you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your enemies? Evil is (this) change for the unjust."/>

		<aya index="57" text="And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communications of his Lord, then he turns away from them and forgets what his two hands have sent before? Surely We have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it and a heaviness in their ears; and if you call them to the guidance, they will not ever follow the right course in that case."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And your Lord is Forgiving, the Lord of Mercy; were He to punish them for what they earn, He would certainly have hastened the chastisement for them; but for them there is an appointed time from which they shall not find a refuge."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And (as for) these towns, We destroyed them when they acted unjustly, and We have appointed a time for their destruction."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And when Musa said to his servant: I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two rivers or I will go on for years."/>
		<aya index="61" text="So when they had reached the junction of the two (rivers) they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the sea, going away."/>
		<aya index="62" text="But when they had gone farther, he said to his servant: Bring to us our morning meal, certainly we have met with fatigue from this our journey."/>
		<aya index="63" text="He said: Did you see when we took refuge on the rock then I forgot the fish, and nothing made me forget to speak of it but the Shaitan, and it took its way into the river; what a wonder!"/>
		<aya index="64" text="He said: This is what we sought for; so they returned retracing their footsteps."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Then they found one from among Our servants whom We had granted mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Ourselves."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Musa said to him: Shall I follow you on condition that you should teach me right knowledge of what you have been taught?"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He said: Surely you cannot have patience with me"/>
		<aya index="68" text="And how can you have patience in that of which you have not got a comprehensive knowledge?"/>
		<aya index="69" text="He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any matter."/>
		<aya index="70" text="He said: If you would follow me, then do not question me about any thing until I myself speak to you about it"/>
		<aya index="71" text="So they went (their way) until when they embarked in the boat he made a hole in it. (Musa) said: Have you made a hole in it to drown its inmates? Certainly you have done a grievous thing."/>
		<aya index="72" text="He said: Did I not say that you will not be able to have patience with me?"/>
		<aya index="73" text="He said: Blame me not for what I forgot, and do not constrain me to a difficult thing in my affair."/>
		<aya index="74" text="So they went on until, when they met a boy, he slew him. (Musa) said: Have you slain an innocent person otherwise than for manslaughter? Certainly you have done an evil thing."/>
		<aya index="75" text="He said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to have patience with me?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="He said: If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company; indeed you shall have (then) found an excuse in my case."/>
		<aya index="77" text="So they went on until when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they found in it a wall which was on the point of falling, so he put it into a right state. (Musa) said: If you had pleased, you might certainly have taken a recompense for it."/>
		<aya index="78" text="He said: This shall be separation between me and you; now I will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience."/>
		<aya index="79" text="As for the boat, it belonged to (some) poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized every boat by force."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And as for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them:"/>
		<aya index="81" text="So we desired that their Lord might give them in his place one better than him in purity and nearer to having compassion."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father was a righteous man; so your Lord desired that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure, a mercy from your Lord, and I did not do it of my own accord. This is the significance of that with which you could not have patience."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And they ask you about Zulqarnain. Say: I will recite to you an account of him."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Surely We established him in the land and granted him means of access to every thing."/>
		<aya index="85" text="So he followed a course."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Until when he reached the place where the sun set, he found it going down into a black sea, and found by it a people. We said: O Zulqarnain! either give them a chastisement or do them a benefit."/>
		<aya index="87" text="He said: As to him who is unjust, we will chastise him, then shall he be returned to his Lord, and He will chastise him with an exemplary chastisement:"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And as for him who believes and does good, he shall have goodly reward, and We will speak to him an easy word of Our command."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Then he followed (another) course."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people to whom We had given no shelter from It;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="Even so! and We had a full knowledge of what he had."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Then he followed (another) course."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Until when he reached (a place) between the two mountains, he found on that side of them a people who could hardly understand a word."/>
		<aya index="94" text="They said: O Zulqarnain! surely Gog and Magog make mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute on condition that you should raise a barrier between us and them"/>
		<aya index="95" text="He said: That in which my Lord has established me is better, therefore you only help me with workers, I will make a fortified barrier between you and them;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="Bring me blocks of iron; until when he had filled up the space between the two mountain sides, he said: Blow, until when he had made it (as) fire, he said: Bring me molten brass which I may pour over it."/>
		<aya index="97" text="So they were not able to scale it nor could they make a hole in it."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said: This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass He will make it level with the ground, and the promise of my Lord is ever true."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And on that day We will leave a part of them in conflict with another part, and the trumpet will be blown, so We will gather them all together;"/>
		<aya index="100" text="And We will bring forth hell, exposed to view, on that day before the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="101" text="They whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they could not even hear."/>
		<aya index="102" text="What! do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants to be guardians besides Me? Surely We have prepared hell for the entertainment of the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Say: Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in (their) deeds?"/>
		<aya index="104" text="(These are) they whose labor is lost in this world's life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hands."/>
		<aya index="105" text="These are they who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord and His meeting, so their deeds become null, and therefore We will not set up a balance for them on the day of resurrection."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Thus it is that their recompense is hell, because they disbelieved and held My communications and My apostles in mockery."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, their place of entertainment shall be the gardens of paradise,"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Abiding therein; they shall not desire removal from them."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Say: If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are exhausted, though We were to bring the like of that (sea) to add"/>
		<aya index="110" text="Say: I am only a mortal like you; it is revealed to me that your god is one Allah, therefore whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds, and not join any one in the service of his Lord."/>

		<aya index="6" text="His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and what is between them two and what is beneath the ground."/>
		<aya index="7" text="And if you utter the saying aloud, then surely He knows the secret, and what is yet more hidden."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Allah-- there is no god but He; His are the very best names."/>
		<aya index="9" text="And has the story of Musa come to you?"/>
		<aya index="10" text="When he saw fire, he said to his family: Stop, for surely I see a fire, haply I may bring to you therefrom a live coal or find a guidance at the fire."/>
		<aya index="11" text="So when he came to it, a voice was uttered: O Musa:"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Surely I am your Lord, therefore put off your shoes; surely you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa,"/>
		<aya index="13" text="And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed:"/>
		<aya index="14" text="Surely I am Allah, there is no god but I, therefore serve Me and keep up prayer for My remembrance:"/>
		<aya index="15" text="Surely the hour is coming-- I am about to make it manifest-- so that every soul may be rewarded as it strives:"/>
		<aya index="16" text="Therefore let not him who believes not in it and follows his low desires turn you away from it so that you should perish;"/>
		<aya index="17" text="And what is this in your right hand, O Musa!"/>
		<aya index="18" text="He said: This is my staff: I recline on it and I beat the leaves with it to make them fall upon my sheep, and I have other uses for it."/>
		<aya index="19" text="He said: Cast it down, O Musa!"/>
		<aya index="20" text="So he cast it down; and lo! it was a serpent running."/>
		<aya index="21" text="He said: Take hold of it and fear not; We will restore it to its former state:"/>
		<aya index="22" text="And press your hand to your side, it shall come out white without evil: another sign:"/>
		<aya index="23" text="That We may show you of Our greater signs:"/>
		<aya index="24" text="Go to Firon, surely he has exceeded all limits."/>
		<aya index="25" text="He said: O my Lord! Expand my breast for me,"/>
		<aya index="26" text="And make my affair easy to me,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="And loose the knot from my tongue,"/>
		<aya index="28" text="(That) they may understand my word;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="And give to me an aider from my family:"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Haroun, my brother,"/>
		<aya index="31" text="Strengthen my back by him,"/>
		<aya index="32" text="And associate him (with me) in my affair,"/>
		<aya index="33" text="So that we should glorify Thee much,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And remember Thee oft."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Surely, Thou art seeing us."/>
		<aya index="36" text="He said: You are indeed granted your petition, O Musa"/>
		<aya index="37" text="And certainly We bestowed on you a favor at another time;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="When We revealed to your mother what was revealed;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="Saying: Put him into a chest, then cast it down into the river, then the river shall throw him on the shore; there shall take him up one who is an enemy to Me and enemy to him, and I cast down upon you love from Me, and that you might be brought up before My eyes;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="When your sister went and said: Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him? So We brought you back to your mother, that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve and you killed a man, then We delivered you from the grief, and We tried you with (a severe) trying. Then you stayed for years among the people of Madyan; then you came hither as ordained, O Musa."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And I have chosen you for Myself:"/>
		<aya index="42" text="Go you and your brother with My communications and be not remiss in remembering Me;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="Go both to Firon, surely he has become inordinate;"/>
		<aya index="44" text="Then speak to him a gentle word haply he may mind or fear."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Both said: O our Lord! Surely we fear that he may hasten to do evil to us or that he may become inordinate."/>
		<aya index="46" text="He said: Fear not, surely I am with you both: I do hear and see."/>
		<aya index="47" text="So go you both to him and say: Surely we are two apostles of your Lord; therefore send the children of Israel with us and do not torment them! Indeed we have brought to you a communication from your Lord, and peace is on him who follows the guidance;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="Surely it has been revealed to us that the chastisement will surely come upon him who rejects and turns back."/>
		<aya index="49" text="(Firon) said: And who is your Lord, O Musa?"/>
		<aya index="50" text="He said: Our Lord is He Who gave to everything its creation, then guided it (to its goal)."/>
		<aya index="51" text="He said: Then what is the state of the former generations?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="He said: The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a book, my Lord errs not, nor does He forget;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Who made the earth for you an expanse and made for you therein paths and sent down water from the cloud; then thereby We have brought forth many species of various herbs."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Eat and pasture your cattle; most surely there are signs in this for those endowed with understanding."/>
		<aya index="55" text="From it We created you and into it We shall send you back and from it will We raise you a second time."/>
		<aya index="56" text="And truly We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he rejected and refused."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Said he: Have you come to us that you should turn us out of our land by your magic, O Musa?"/>
		<aya index="58" text="So we too will produce before you magic like it, therefore make between us and you an appointment, which we should not break, (neither) we nor you, (in) a central place."/>
		<aya index="59" text="(Musa) said: Your appointment is the day of the Festival and let the people be gathered together in the early forenoon."/>
		<aya index="60" text="So Firon turned his back and settled his plan, then came."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Musa said to them: Woe to you! do not forge a lie against Allah, lest He destroy you by a punishment, and he who forges (a lie) indeed fails to attain (his desire)."/>
		<aya index="62" text="So they disputed with one another about their affair and kept the discourse secret."/>
		<aya index="63" text="They said: These are most surely two magicians who wish to turn you out from your land by their magic and to take away your best traditions."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Therefore settle your plan, then come standing in ranks and he will prosper indeed this day who overcomes."/>
		<aya index="65" text="They said: O Musa! will you cast, or shall we be the first who cast down?"/>
		<aya index="66" text="He said: Nay! cast down. then lo! their cords and their rods-- it was imaged to him on account of their magic as if they were running."/>
		<aya index="67" text="So Musa conceived in his mind a fear."/>
		<aya index="68" text="We said: Fear not, surely you shall be the uppermost,"/>
		<aya index="69" text="And cast down what is in your right hand; it shall devour what they have wrought; they have wrought only the plan of a magician, and the magician shall not be successful wheresoever he may come from."/>
		<aya index="70" text="And the magicians were cast down making obeisance; they said: We believe in the Lord of Haroun and Musa."/>
		<aya index="71" text="(Firon) said: You believe in him before I give you leave; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchantment, therefore I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will certainly crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and certainly you will come to know which of us is the more severe and the more abiding in chastising."/>
		<aya index="72" text="They said: We do not prefer you to what has come to us of clear arguments and to He Who made us, therefore decide what you are going to decide; you can only decide about this world's life."/>
		<aya index="73" text="Surely we believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic to which you compelled us; and Allah is better and more abiding."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Whoever comes to his Lord (being) guilty, for him is surely hell; he shall not die therein, nor shall he live."/>
		<aya index="75" text="And whoever comes to Him a believer (and) he has done good deeds indeed, these it is who shall have the high ranks,"/>
		<aya index="76" text="The gardens of perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein; and this is the reward of him who has purified himself."/>
		<aya index="77" text="And certainly We revealed to Musa, saying: Travel by night with My servants, then make for them a dry path in the sea, not fearing to be overtaken, nor being afraid."/>
		<aya index="78" text="And Firon followed them with his armies, so there came upon them of the sea that which came upon them."/>
		<aya index="79" text="And Firon led astray his people and he did not guide (them) aright."/>
		<aya index="80" text="O children of Israel! indeed We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the mountain, and We sent to you the manna and the quails."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Eat of the good things We have given you for sustenance, and be not inordinate with respect to them, lest My wrath should be due to you, and to whomsoever My wrath is due be shall perish indeed."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And most surely I am most Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good, then continues to follow the right direction."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And what caused you to hasten from your people, O Musa?"/>
		<aya index="84" text="He said: They are here on my track and I hastened on to Thee, my Lord, that Thou mightest be pleased."/>
		<aya index="85" text="He said: So surely We have tried your people after you, and the Samiri has led them astray."/>
		<aya index="86" text="So Musa returned to his people wrathful, sorrowing. Said he: O my people! did not your Lord promise you a goodly promise: did then the time seem long to you, or did you wish that displeasure from your Lord should be due to you, so that you broke (your) promise to me?"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: We did not break (our) promise to you of our own accord, but we were made to bear the burdens of the ornaments of the people, then we made a casting of them, and thus did the Samiri suggest."/>
		<aya index="88" text="So he brought forth for them a calf, a (mere) body, which had a mooing sound, so they said: This is your god and the god of Musa, but he forgot."/>
		<aya index="89" text="What! could they not see that it did not return to them a reply, and (that) it did not control any harm or benefit for them?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="And certainly Haroun had said to them before: O my people! you are only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent Allah, therefore follow me and obey my order."/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: We will by no means cease to keep to its worship until Musa returns to us."/>
		<aya index="92" text="(Musa) said: O Haroun! what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,"/>
		<aya index="93" text="So that you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my order?"/>
		<aya index="94" text="He said: O son of my mother! seize me not by my beard nor by my head; surely I was afraid lest you should say: You have caused a division among the children of Israel and not waited for my word."/>
		<aya index="95" text="He said: What was then your object, O Samiri?"/>
		<aya index="96" text="He said: I saw (Jibreel) what they did not see, so I took a handful (of the dust) from the footsteps of the messenger, then I threw it in the casting; thus did my soul commend to me"/>
		<aya index="97" text="He said: Begone then, surely for you it will be in this life to say, Touch (me) not; and surely there is a threat for you, which shall not be made to fail to you, and look at your god to whose worship you kept (so long); we will certainly burn it, then we will certainly scatter it a (wide) scattering in the sea."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Your Allah is only Allah, there is no god but He; He comprehends all things in (His) knowledge."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Thus do We relate to you (some) of the news of what has gone before; and indeed We have given to you a Reminder from Ourselves."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Whoever turns aside from it, he shall surely bear a burden on the day of resurrection"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Abiding in this (state), and evil will it be for them to bear on the day of resurrection;"/>
		<aya index="102" text="On the day when the trumpet shall be blown, and We will gather the guilty, blue-eyed, on that day"/>
		<aya index="103" text="They shall consult together secretly: You did tarry but ten (centuries)."/>
		<aya index="104" text="We know best what they say, when the fairest of them in course would say: You tarried but a day."/>
		<aya index="105" text="And they ask you about the mountains. Say: My Lord will carry them away from the roots."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Then leave it a plain, smooth level"/>
		<aya index="107" text="You shall not see therein any crookedness or unevenness."/>
		<aya index="108" text="On that day they shall follow the inviter, there is no crookedness in him, and the voices shall be low before the Beneficent Allah so that you shall not hear aught but a soft sound."/>
		<aya index="109" text="On that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Beneficent Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with."/>
		<aya index="110" text="He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And the faces shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-subsistent Allah, and he who bears iniquity is indeed a failure."/>
		<aya index="112" text="And whoever does good works and he is a believer, he shall have no fear of injustice nor of the withholding of his due."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And thus have We sent it down an Arabic Quran, and have distinctly set forth therein of threats that they may guard (against evil) or that it may produce a reminder for them."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Supremely exalted is therefore Allah, the King, the Truth, and do not make haste with the Quran before its revelation is made complete to you and say: O my Lord! increase me in knowledge."/>
		<aya index="115" text="And certainly We gave a commandment to Adam before, but he forgot; and We did not find in him any determination."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam, they made obeisance, but Iblis (did it not); he refused."/>
		<aya index="117" text="So We said: O Adam! This is an enemy to you and to your wife; therefore let him not drive you both forth from the garden so that you should be unhappy;"/>
		<aya index="118" text="Surely it is (ordained) for you that you shall not be hungry therein nor bare of clothing;"/>
		<aya index="119" text="And that you shall not be thirsty therein nor shall you feel the heat of the sun."/>
		<aya index="120" text="But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to him; he said: O Adam! Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which decays not?"/>
		<aya index="121" text="Then they both ate of it, so their evil inclinations became manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with leaves of the garden, and Adam disobeyed his Lord, so his life became evil (to him)."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Then his Lord chose him, so He turned to him and guided (him)."/>
		<aya index="123" text="He said: Get forth you two therefrom, all (of you), one of you (is) enemy to another. So there will surely come to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, he shall not go astray nor be unhappy;"/>
		<aya index="124" text="And whoever turns away from My reminder, his shall be a straitened life, and We will raise him on the day of resurrection, blind."/>
		<aya index="125" text="He shall say: My Lord! why hast Thou raised me blind and I was a seeing one indeed?"/>
		<aya index="126" text="He will say: Even so, Our communications came to you but you neglected them; even thus shall you be forsaken this day."/>
		<aya index="127" text="And thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and does not believe in the communications of his Lord, and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is severer and more"/>
		<aya index="128" text="Does it not then direct them aright how many of the generations In whose dwelling-places they go about We destroyed before them? Most surely there are signs in this for those endowed with understanding."/>
		<aya index="129" text="And had there not been a word (that had) already gone forth from your Lord and an appointed term, it would surely have been made to cleave (to them)."/>
		<aya index="130" text="Bear then patiently what they say, and glorify your Lord by the praising of Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting, and during hours of the night do also glorify (Him) and during parts of the day, that you may be well pleased"/>
		<aya index="131" text="And do not stretch your eyes after that with which We have provided different classes of them, (of) the splendor of this world's life, that We may thereby try them; and the sustenance (given) by your Lord is better and more abiding."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And enjoin prayer on your followers, and steadily adhere to it; We do not ask you for subsistence; We do give you subsistence, and the (good) end is for guarding (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="133" text="And they say: Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord? Has not there come to them a clear evidence of what is in the previous books?"/>
		<aya index="134" text="And had We destroyed them with chastisement before this, they would certainly have said: O our Lord! why didst Thou not send to us an apostle, for then we should have followed Thy communications before that we met disgrace and shame."/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say: Every one (of us) is awaiting, therefore do await: So you will come to know who is the follower of the even path and who goes aright."/>

		<aya index="63" text="Do not hold the Apostle's calling (you) among you to be like your calling one to the other; Allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you, concealing themselves; therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement."/>

		<aya index="28" text="Take this my letter and hand it over to them, then turn away from them and see what (answer) they return."/>
		<aya index="29" text="She said: O chief! surely an honorable letter has been delivered to me"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Surely it is from Sulaiman, and surely it is in the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="Saying: exalt not yourselves against me and come to me in submission."/>
		<aya index="32" text="She said: O chiefs! give me advice respecting my affair: I never decide an affair until you are in my presence."/>
		<aya index="33" text="They said: We are possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess, and the command is yours, therefore see what you will command."/>
		<aya index="34" text="She said: Surely the kings, when they enter a town, ruin it and make the noblest of its people to be low, and thus they (always) do;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="And surely I am going to send a present to them, and shall wait to see what (answer) do the apostles bring back."/>
		<aya index="36" text="So when he came to Sulaiman, he said: What! will you help me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Nay, you are exultant because of your present;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Go back to them, so we will most certainly come to them with hosts which they shall have no power to oppose, and we will most certainly expel them therefrom in abasement, and they shall be in a state of ignominy."/>
		<aya index="38" text="He said: O chiefs! which of you can bring to me her throne before they come to me in submission?"/>
		<aya index="39" text="One audacious among the jinn said: I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place; and most surely I am strong (and) trusty for it."/>
		<aya index="40" text="One who had the knowledge of the Book said: I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye. Then when he saw it settled beside him, he said: This is of the grace of my Lord that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful; and whoever is grateful, he is grateful only for his own soul, and whoever is ungrateful, then surely my Lord is Self-sufficient, Honored."/>
		<aya index="41" text="He said: Alter her throne for her, we will see whether she follows the right way or is of those who do not go aright."/>
		<aya index="42" text="So when she came, it was said: Is your throne like this? She said: It is as it were the same, and we were given the knowledge before it, and we were submissive."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And what she worshipped besides Allah prevented her, surely she was of an unbelieving people."/>
		<aya index="44" text="It was said to her: Enter the palace; but when she saw it she deemed it to be a great expanse of water, and bared her legs. He said: Surely it is a palace made smooth with glass. She said: My Lord! surely I have been unjust to myself, and I submit with Sulaiman to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And certainly We sent to Samood their brother Salih, saying: Serve Allah; and lo! they became two sects quarrelling with each other."/>
		<aya index="46" text="He said: O my people! why do you seek to hasten on the evil before the good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that you may be dealt with mercifully?"/>
		<aya index="47" text="They said: We have met with ill luck on account of you and on account of those with you. He said: The cause of your evil fortune is with Allah; nay, you are a people who are tried."/>
		<aya index="48" text="And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and did not act aright."/>
		<aya index="49" text="They said: Swear to each other by Allah that we will certainly make a sudden attack on him and his family by night, then we will say to his heir: We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are most surely truthful."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan while they perceived not."/>
		<aya index="51" text="See, then, how was the end of their plan that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them)."/>
		<aya index="52" text="So those are their houses fallen down because they were unjust, most surely there is a sign in this for a people who know."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And We delivered those who believed and who guarded (against evil)."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And (We sent) Lut, when he said to his people: What! do you commit indecency while you see?"/>
		<aya index="55" text="What! do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than women? Nay, you are a people who act ignorantly."/>
		<aya index="56" text="But the answer of his people was no other except that they ~s said: Turn out Lut's followers from your town; surely they are a people who would keep pure!"/>
		<aya index="57" text="But We delivered him and his followers except his wife; We ordained her to be of those who remained behind."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And We rained on them a rain, and evil was the rain of those who had been warned."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Say: Praise be to Allah and peace on His servants whom He has chosen: is Allah better, or what they associate (with Him)?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Nay, He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down for you water from the cloud; then We cause to grow thereby beautiful gardens; it is not possible for you that you should make the trees thereof to grow. Is there a god with Allah? Nay! they are people who deviate."/>

		<aya index="71" text="And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say: Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of that which you seek to hasten on."/>
		<aya index="73" text="And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men, but most of them are not grateful."/>
		<aya index="74" text="And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest."/>
		<aya index="75" text="And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel most of what they differ in."/>
		<aya index="77" text="And most surely it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers."/>

		<aya index="2" text="These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) clear."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We recite to you from the account of Musa and Firon with truth for people who believe."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Surely Firon exalted himself in the land and made its people into parties, weakening one party from among them; he slaughtered their sons and let their women live; surely he was one of the mischiefmakers."/>
		<aya index="5" text="And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in the land, and to make them the Imams, and to make them the heirs,"/>
		<aya index="6" text="And to grant them power in the land, and to make Firon and Haman and their hosts see from them what they feared."/>
		<aya index="7" text="And We revealed to Musa's mothers, saying: Give him suck, then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve; surely We will bring him back to you and make him one of the apostles."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And Firon's family took him up that he might be an enemy and a grief for them; surely Firon and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="9" text="And Firon's wife said: A refreshment of the eye to me and to you; do not slay him; maybe he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son; and they did not perceive."/>
		<aya index="10" text="And the heart of Musa's mother was free (from anxiety) she would have almost disclosed it had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believers."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And she said to his sister: Follow him up. So she watched him from a distance while they did not perceive,"/>
		<aya index="12" text="And We ordained that he refused to suck any foster mother before, so she said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house who will take care of him for you, and they will be benevolent to him?"/>
		<aya index="13" text="So We gave him back to his mother that her eye might be refreshed, and that she might no grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true, but most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when he attained his maturity and became full grown, We granted him wisdom and knowledge; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others)."/>
		<aya index="15" text="And he went into the city at a time of unvigilance on the part of its people, so he found therein two men fighting, one being of his party and the other of his foes, and he who was of his party cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies, so Musa struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is on account of the Shaitan's doing; surely he is an enemy, openly leading astray."/>
		<aya index="16" text="He said: My Lord! surely I have done harm to myself, so do Thou protect me. So He protected him; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="17" text="He said: My Lord! because Thou hast bestowed a favor on me, I shall never be a backer of the guilty."/>
		<aya index="18" text="And he was in the city, fearing, awaiting, when lo! he who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out to him for aid. Musa said to him: You are most surely one erring manifestly."/>
		<aya index="19" text="So when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them both, he said: O Musa! do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You desire nothing but that you should be a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be of those who act aright."/>
		<aya index="20" text="And a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said: O Musa! surely the chiefs are consulting together to slay you, therefore depart (at once); surely I am of those who wish well to you."/>
		<aya index="21" text="So he went forth therefrom, fearing, awaiting, (and) he said: My Lord! deliver me from the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he turned his face towards Madyan, he said: Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And when he came to the water of Madyan, he found on it a group of men watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you? They said: We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from the water, and our father is a very old man."/>
		<aya index="24" text="So he watered (their sheep) for them, then went back to the shade and said: My Lord! surely I stand in need of whatever good Thou mayest send down to me."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully. She said: My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us. So when he came to him and gave to him the account, he said: Fear not, you are secure from the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Said one of them: O my father! employ him, surely the best of those that you can employ is the strong man, the faithful one."/>
		<aya index="27" text="He said: I desire to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will, and I do not wish to be hard to you; if Allah please, you will find me one of the good."/>
		<aya index="28" text="He said: This shall be (an agreement) between me and you; whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of what we say."/>
		<aya index="29" text="So when Musa had fulfilled the term, and he journeyed with his family, he perceived on this side of the mountain a fire. He said to his family: Wait, I have seen a fire, maybe I will bring to you from it some news or a brand of fire, so that you may warm yourselves."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And when he came to it, a voice was uttered from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush, saying: O Musa! surely I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds."/>
		<aya index="31" text="And saying: Cast down you staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent, he turned back retreating, and did not return. O Musa! come forward and fear not; surely you are of those who are secure;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Enter your hand into the opening of your bosom, it will come forth white without evil, and draw your hand to yourself to ward off fear: so these two shall be two arguments from your Lord to Firon and his chiefs, surely they are a transgressing people."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: My Lord! surely I killed one of them, so I fear lest they should slay me;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And my brother, Haroun, he is more eloquent of tongue than I, therefore send him with me as an aider, verifying me: surely I fear that they would reject me."/>
		<aya index="35" text="He said: We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and We will give you both an authority, so that they shall not reach you; (go) with Our signs; you two and those who follow you shall be uppermost."/>
		<aya index="36" text="So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said: This is nothing but forged enchantment, and we never heard of it amongst our fathers of old."/>
		<aya index="37" text="And Musa said: My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and whose shall be the good end of the abode; surely the unjust shall not be successful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And Firon said: O chiefs! I do not know of any god for you besides myself; therefore kindle a fire for me, O Haman, for brick, then prepare for me a lofty building so that I may obtain knowledge of Musa's god, and most surely I think him to be one of the liars."/>
		<aya index="39" text="And he was unjustly proud in the land, he and his hosts, and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us."/>
		<aya index="40" text="So We caught hold of him and his hosts, then We cast them into the sea, and see how was the end of the unjust."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And We made them Imams who call to the fire, and on the day of resurrection they shall not be assisted."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And We caused a curse to follow them in this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to appear hideous."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And certainly We gave Musa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations, clear arguments for men and a guidance and a mercy, that they may be mindful."/>
		<aya index="44" text="And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="But We raised up generations, then life became prolonged to them; and you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our communications, but We were the senders."/>
		<aya index="46" text="And you were not on this side of the mountain when We called, but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you, that they may be mindful."/>
		<aya index="47" text="And were it not that there should befall them a disaster for what their hands have sent before, then they should say: Our Lord! why didst Thou not send to us an apostle so that we should have followed Thy communications and been of the believers!"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But (now) when the truth has come to them from Us, they say: Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa? What! did they not disbelieve in what Musa was given before? They say: Two magicians backing up each other; and they say: Surely we are unbelievers in all."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say: Then bring some (other) book from Allah which is a better guide than both of them, (that) I may follow it, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="50" text="But if they do not answer you, then know that they only follow their low desires; and who is more erring than he who follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful."/>
		<aya index="52" text="(As to) those whom We gave the Book before it, they are believers in it."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when it is recited to them they say: We believe in it surely it is the truth from our Lord; surely we were submitters before this."/>
		<aya index="54" text="These shall be granted their reward twice, because they are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of what We have given them."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and say: We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; peace be on you, we do not desire the ignorant."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Surely you cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He pleases, and He knows best the followers of the right way."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And they say: If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be carried off from our country. What! have We not settled them in a safe, sacred territory to which fruits of every kind shall be drawn?-- a sustenance from Us; but most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And how many a town have We destroyed which exulted in its means of subsistence, so these are their abodes, they have not been dwelt in after them except a little, and We are the inheritors,"/>
		<aya index="59" text="And your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised in their metropolis an apostle, reciting to them Our communications, and We never destroyed the towns except when their people were unjust."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And whatever things you have been given are only a provision of this world's life and its adornment, and whatever is with Allah is better and more lasting; do you not then understand?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise which he shall meet with like him whom We have provided with the provisions of this world's life, then on the day of resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="And on the day when He will call them and say: Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates?"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those against whom the sentence has become confirmed will say: Our Lord! these are they whom we caused to err; we caused them to err as we ourselves did err; to Thee we declare ourselves to be clear (of them); they never served Us."/>
		<aya index="64" text="And it will be said: Call your associate-gods. So they will call upon them, but they will not answer them, and they shall see the punishment; would that they had followed the right way!"/>
		<aya index="65" text="And on the day when He shall call them and say: What was the answer you gave to the apostles?"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Then the pleas shall become obscure to them on that day, so they shall not ask each other."/>
		<aya index="67" text="But as to him who repents and believes and does good, maybe he will be among the successful:"/>
		<aya index="68" text="And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases; to choose is not theirs; glory be to Allah, and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him)."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest."/>
		<aya index="70" text="And He is Allah, there is no god but He! All praise is due to Him in this (life) and the hereafter, and His is the judgment, and to Him you shall be brought back."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Say: Tell me, if Allah were to make the night to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides Allah that could bring you light? Do you not then hear?"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say: Tell me, if Allah were to make the day to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides Allah that could bring you the night in which you take rest? Do you not then see?"/>
		<aya index="73" text="And out of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, that you may rest therein, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="74" text="And on the day when He shall call them and say: Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates?"/>
		<aya index="75" text="And We will draw forth from among every nation a witness and say: Bring your proof; then shall they know that the truth is Allah's, and that which they forged shall depart from them."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Surely Qaroun was of the people of Musa, but he rebelled against them, and We had given him of the treasures, so much so that his hoards of wealth would certainly weigh down a company of men possessed of great strength. When his people said to him: Do not exult, surely Allah does not love the exultant;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="And seek by means of what Allah has given you the future abode, and do not neglect your portion of this world, and do good (to others) as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land, surely Allah does not love the mischief-makers."/>
		<aya index="78" text="He said: I have been given this only on account of the knowledge I have. Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him of the generations those who were mightier in strength than he and greater in assemblage? And the guilty shall not be asked about their faults."/>
		<aya index="79" text="So he went forth to his people in his finery. Those who desire this world's life said: O would that we had the like of what Qaroun is given; most surely he is possessed of mighty good fortune."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good, and none is made to receive this except the patient."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Thus We made the earth to swallow up him and his abode; so he had no body of helpers to assist him against Allah nor was he of those who can defend themselves."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those who yearned for his place only the day before began to say: Ah! (know) that Allah amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants; had not Allah been gracious to us, He would most surely have abased us; ah! (know) that the ungrateful are never successful."/>
		<aya index="83" text="(As for) that future abode, We assign it to those who have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make mischief and the good end is for those who guard (against evil)"/>
		<aya index="84" text="Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil, those who do evil shall not be rewarded (for) aught except what they did."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Most surely He Who has made the Quran binding on you will bring you back to the destination. Say: My Lord knows best him who has brought the guidance and him who is in manifest error."/>
		<aya index="86" text="And you did not expect that the Book would be inspired to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord, therefore be not a backer-up of the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And let them not turn you aside from the communications of Allah after they have been revealed to you, and call (men) to your Lord and be not of the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And call not with Allah any other god; there is no god but He, every thing is perishable but He; His is the judgment, and to Him you shall be brought back."/>

		<aya index="14" text="If you call on them they shall not hear your call, and even if they could hear they shall not answer you; and on the resurrection day they will deny your associating them (with Allah); and none can inform you like the One Who is Aware."/>

You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; and whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own soul; and to Allah is the eventual coming."/>

		<aya index="25" text="And if they call you a liar, so did those before them indeed call (their apostles) liars; their apostles had come to them with clear arguments, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating book."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Then did I punish those who disbelieved, so how was the manifestation of My disapproval?"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colors; and in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various hues and (others) intensely black?"/>

		<aya index="32" text="Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants; but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss, and of them is he who takes a middle course, and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by Allah's permission; this is the great excellence."/>

		<aya index="36" text="And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is the fire of hell; it shall not be finished with them entirely so that they should die, nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them: even thus do We retribute every ungrateful one."/>
		<aya index="37" text="And they shall cry therein for succour: O our Lord! take us out, we will do good deeds other than those which we used to do. Did We not preserve you alive long enough, so that he who would be mindful in it should mind? And there came to you the warner; therefore taste; because for the unjust, there is no helper."/>
		<aya index="38" text="Surely Allah is the Knower of what is unseen in the heavens and the earth; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts."/>
		<aya index="39" text="He it is Who made you rulers in the land; therefore whoever disbelieves, his unbelief is against himself; and their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything except hatred; and their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything except loss."/>

Show me what part of the earth they have created, or have they any share in the heavens; or, have We given them a book so that they follow a clear argument thereof? Nay, the unjust do not hold out promises one to another but only to deceive."/>

		<aya index="42" text="And they swore by Allah with the strongest of their oaths that if there came to them a warner they would be better guided than any of the nations; but when there came to them a warner it increased them in naught but aversion."/>
		<aya index="43" text="(In) behaving proudly in the land and in planning evil; and the evil plans shall not beset any save the authors of it. Then should they wait for aught except the way of the former people? For you shall not find any alteration in the course of Allah; and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them while they were stronger than these in power? And Allah is not such that any thing in the heavens or in the earth should escape Him; surely He is Knowing, Powerful."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And were Allah to punish men for what they earn, He would not leave on the back of it any creature, but He respites them till an appointed term; so when their doom shall come, then surely Allah is Seeing with respect to His servants."/>

		<aya index="10" text="And He made in it mountains above its surface, and He blessed therein and made therein its foods, in four periods: alike for the seekers."/>
		<aya index="11" text="Then He directed Himself to the heaven and it is a vapor, so He said to it and to the earth: Come both, willingly or unwillingly. They both said: We come willingly."/>
		<aya index="12" text="So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods, and revealed in every heaven its affair; and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and (made it) to guard; that is the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing."/>
		<aya index="13" text="But if they turn aside, then say: I have warned you of a scourge like the scourge of Ad and Samood."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When their apostles came to them from before them and from behind them, saying, Serve nothing but Allah, they said: If our Lord had pleased He would certainly have sent down angels, so we are surely unbelievers in that with which you are sent."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Then as to Ad, they were unjustly proud in the land, and they said: Who is mightier in strength than we? Did they not see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in strength, and they denied Our communications?"/>

		<aya index="44" text="And if We had made it a Quran in a foreign tongue, they would certainly have said: Why have not its communications been made clear? What! a foreign (tongue) and an Arabian! Say: It is to those who believe a guidance and a healing; and (as for) those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears and it is obscure to them; these shall be called to from a far-off place."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And certainly We gave the Book to Musa, but it has been differed about, and had not a word already gone forth from your Lord, judgment would certainly have been given between them; and most surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it."/>

		<aya index="23" text="That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, (to) those who believe and do good deeds. Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Or do they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? But if Allah pleased, He would seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts."/>

		<aya index="26" text="And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more out of His grace; and (as for) the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment."/>
		<aya index="27" text="And if Allah should amplify the provision for His servants they would certainly revolt in the earth; but He sends it down according to a measure as He pleases; surely He is Aware of, Seeing, His servants."/>
		<aya index="28" text="And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praised One."/>
		<aya index="29" text="And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has spread forth in both of them of living beings; and when He pleases He is all-powerful to gather them together."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought, and (yet) He pardons most (of your faults)."/>
		<aya index="31" text="And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper besides Allah."/>
		<aya index="32" text="And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains."/>
		<aya index="33" text="If He pleases, He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its back; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="Or He may make them founder for what they have earned, and (even then) pardon most;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="And (that) those who dispute about Our communications may know; there is no place of refuge for them."/>
		<aya index="36" text="So whatever thing you are given, that is only a provision of this world's life, and what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on their Lord."/>
		<aya index="37" text="And those who. shun the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they forgive."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer, and their rule is to take counsel among themselves, and who spend out of what We have given them."/>
		<aya index="39" text="And those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend themselves."/>
		<aya index="40" text="And the recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends, he shall have his reward from Allah; surely He does not love the unjust."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed, these it is against whom there is no way (to blame)."/>
		<aya index="42" text="The way (to blame) is only against those who oppress men and revolt in the earth unjustly; these shall have a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And whoever is patient and forgiving, these most surely are actions due to courage."/>
		<aya index="44" text="And whomsoever Allah makes err, he has no guardian after Him; and you shall see the unjust, when they see the punishment, saying: Is there any way to return?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And you shall see them brought before it humbling themselves because of the abasements, looking with a faint glance. And those who believe shall say: Surely the losers are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the resurrection day. Now surely the iniquitous shall remain in lasting chastisement."/>
		<aya index="46" text="And they shall have no friends to help them besides Allah; and-- whomsoever Allah makes err, he shall have no way."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Hearken to your Lord before there comes the day from Allah for which there shall be no averting; you shall have no refuge on that day, nor shall it be yours to make a denial."/>
		<aya index="48" text="But if they turn aside, We have not sent you as a watcher over them; on you is only to deliver (the message); and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices thereat; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already done, then-surely man is ungrateful."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He pleases; He grants to whom He pleases daughters and grants to whom He pleases sons."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Or He makes them of both sorts, male and female; and He makes whom He pleases barren; surely He is the Knowing, the Powerful."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger and revealing by His permission what He pleases; surely He is High, Wise."/>
		<aya index="52" text="And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor (what) the faith (was), but We made it a light, guiding thereby whom We please of Our servants; and most surely you show the way to the right path:"/>
		<aya index="53" text="The path of Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come."/>

		<aya index="48" text="And We did not show them a sign but it was greater than its like, and We overtook them with chastisement that they may turn."/>

		<aya index="75" text="It shall not be abated from them and they shall therein be despairing."/>
		<aya index="76" text="And We are not unjust to them, but they themselves were unjust."/>
		<aya index="77" text="And they shall call out: O Malik! let your Lord make an end of us. He shall say: Surely you shall tarry."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Certainly We have brought you the truth, but most of you are averse to the truth."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Or have they settled an affair? Then surely We are the settlers."/>

		<aya index="7" text="And when Our clear communications are recited to them, those who disbelieve say with regard to the truth when it comes to them: This is clear magic."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Nay! they say: He has forged it. Say: If I have forged it, you do not control anything for me from Allah; He knows best what you utter concerning it; He is enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Say: I am not the first of the apostles, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you: I do not follow anything but that which is revealed to me, and I am nothing but a plain warner."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Say: Have you considered if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from among the children of Israel has borne witness of one like it, so he believed, while you are big with pride; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe: If it had been a good, they would not have gone ahead of us therein. And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby, they say: It is an old lie."/>
		<aya index="12" text="And before it the Book of Musa was a guide and a mercy: and this is a Book verifying (it) in the Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for the doers of good."/>

		<aya index="14" text="These are the dwellers of the garden, abiding therein: a reward for what they did."/>
		<aya index="15" text="And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his parents; with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth; and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months; until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years, he says: My Lord! grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do good which pleases Thee and do good to me in respect of my offspring; surely I turn to Thee, and surely I am of those who submit."/>
		<aya index="16" text="These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds, among the dwellers of the garden; the promise of truth which they were promised."/>
		<aya index="17" text="And he who says to his parents: Fie on you! do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me? And they both call for Allah's aid: Woe to you! believe, surely the promise of Allah is true. But he says: This is nothing but stories of the ancients."/>

		<aya index="20" text="And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: You did away with your good things in your life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while, so today you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abasement because you were unjustly proud in the land and because you transgressed."/>
		<aya index="21" text="And mention the brother of Ad; when he warned his people in the sandy plains,-- and indeed warners came before him and after him-- saying Serve none but Allah; surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day."/>
		<aya index="22" text="They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods; then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones."/>
		<aya index="23" text="He said: The knowledge is only with Allah, and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent, but I see you are a people who are ignorant."/>
		<aya index="24" text="So when they saw it as a cloud appearing in the sky advancing towards their valleys, they said: This is a cloud which will give us rain. Nay! it is what you sought to hasten on, a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment,"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Destroying everything by the command of its Lord, so they became such that naught could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty people."/>
		<aya index="26" text="And certainly We had established them in what We have not established you in, and We had given-- them ears and eyes and hearts, but neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts availed them aught, since they denied the communications of Allah, and that which they mocked encompassed them."/>
		<aya index="27" text="And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you, and We repeat the communications that they might turn."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Why did not then those help them whom they took for gods besides Allah to draw (them) nigh (to Him)? Nay! they were lost to them; and this was their lie and what they forged."/>
		<aya index="29" text="And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn who listened to the Quran; so when they came to it, they said: Be silent; then when it was finished, they turned back to their people warning (them)."/>
		<aya index="30" text="They said: O our people! we have listened to a Book revealed after Musa verifying that which is before it, guiding to the truth and to a right path:"/>
		<aya index="31" text="O our people! accept the Divine caller and believe in Him, He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="32" text="And whoever does not accept the-Divine caller, he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians besides Him, these are in manifest error."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Have they not considered that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Aye! He has surely power over all things."/>
		<aya index="34" text="And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: Is it not true? They shall say: Aye! by our Lord! He will say: Then taste the punishment, because you disbelieved."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Therefore bear up patiently as did the apostles endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not tarried save an hour of the day. A sufficient exposition! Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people?"/>

		<aya index="3" text="That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers."/>
		<aya index="4" text="So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish."/>

		<aya index="10" text="Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them: Allah brought down destruction upon them, and the unbelievers shall have the like of it."/>
		<aya index="11" text="That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the unbelievers shall have no protector for them."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as the beasts eat, and the fire is their abode."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And how many a town which was far more powerful than the town of yours which has driven you out: We destroyed them so there was no helper for them."/>
		<aya index="14" text="What! is he who has a clear argument from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming: and they follow their low desires."/>
		<aya index="15" text="A parable of the garden which those guarding (against evil) are promised: Therein are rivers of water that does not alter, and rivers of milk the taste whereof does not change, and rivers of drink delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey clarified and for them therein are all fruits and protection from their Lord. (Are these) like those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder."/>

		<aya index="20" text="And those who believe say: Why has not a chapter been revealed? But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death. Woe to them then!"/>

		<aya index="25" text="Surely (as for) those who return on their backs after that guidance has become manifest to them, the Shaitan has made it a light matter to them; and He gives them respite."/>
		<aya index="26" text="That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed: We will obey you in some of the affairs; and Allah knows their secrets."/>
		<aya index="27" text="But how will it be when the angels cause them to die smiting their backs."/>
		<aya index="28" text="That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah and are averse to His pleasure, therefore He has made null their deeds."/>

		<aya index="34" text="Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, then they die while they are unbelievers, Allah will by no means forgive them."/>
