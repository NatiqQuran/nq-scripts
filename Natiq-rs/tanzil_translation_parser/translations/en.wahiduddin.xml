	</sura>
	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif Lam Mim."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This is the Book; there is no doubt in it. It is a guide for those who are mindful of God,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="who believe in the unseen, and are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them with;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="those who believe in the revelation sent down to you and in what was sent before you, and firmly believe in the life to come --"/>
		<aya index="5" text="they are the people who are rightly following their Lord and it is they who shall be successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for those who are bent on denying the truth, it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or not, they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="God has sealed their hearts and their ears, and over their eyes there is a covering. They will have a terrible punishment."/>
		<aya index="8" text="There are some who say, &quot;We believe in God and the Last Day,&quot; yet they are not believers."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They seek to deceive God and the believers, but they only deceive themselves, though they do not realize it."/>
		<aya index="10" text="In their hearts is a disease, which God has increased. They will have a painful punishment, because they have been lying."/>
		<aya index="11" text="When they are told, &quot;Do not cause corruption in the land,&quot; they say, &quot;We are only promoters of peace,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="but it is they who are really causing corruption, though they do not realize it."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when they are told, &quot;Believe as other people have believed,&quot; they say, &quot;Are we to believe just as fools believe?&quot; Surely they are the fools, even though they do not realize it."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet those who believe, they say, &quot;We believe.&quot; But when they are alone with their evil leaders, they say, &quot;We are really with you; we were only mocking.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="God will requite them for their mockery, and draw them on, for a while, to wander blindly in their insolence."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Such are those who have taken misguidance in exchange for guidance; but their bargain does not profit them, nor have they found true guidance."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They are like those who kindled a fire, and when it lighted up all around them, God took away their sight and left them in utter darkness, unable to see --"/>
		<aya index="18" text="deaf, dumb, and blind: they will never return [to the right path]."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or their case is like that of heavy rain pouring down from the clouds, accompanied by darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of thunderclaps for fear of death. God thus encompasses those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning almost takes away their sight: whenever it flashes upon them, they walk on, but as soon as darkness falls around them, they stand still. Indeed, if God pleased, He could take away their hearing and their sight: God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="People, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous,"/>
		<aya index="22" text="who made the earth a bed, and the sky a canopy; and it is He who sends down rain from above for the growth of every kind of food for your sustenance. And do not knowingly set up rivals to God."/>
		<aya index="23" text="If you are in doubt about the revelation We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a single chapter like it, and call upon your helpers besides God, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you cannot do it, and you can never do it, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Give the good news to those who believe and do good works, that they will have Gardens through which rivers flow: whenever they are given fruit to eat they will say, &quot;This is what we were provided with before,&quot; because they were given similar things. And there will be pure spouses for them, and they will abide there forever."/>
		<aya index="26" text="God does not disdain to give a parable about a gnat or a smaller creature. The faithful know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who deny the truth ask, &quot;What could God mean by this parable?&quot; He lets many go astray through it, and guides many by it. But He makes only the disobedient go astray:"/>
		<aya index="27" text="those who break God's covenant after they have pledged to keep it, and sever whatever God has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the land -- it is they who are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How can you disbelieve in God when you were dead [lifeless] and He gave you life? He will let you die once more, then bring you back to life again, whereupon you will be returned to Him."/>
		<aya index="29" text="It is He who created everything on the earth for you: then He turned towards heaven and fashioned it into the seven heavens. He has knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="30" text="When your Lord said to the angels, &quot;I am putting a successor on earth,&quot; they said, &quot;Will You place someone there who will cause corruption on it and shed blood, while we glorify You with Your praise and extol Your holiness?&quot; [God] answered, &quot;Surely, I know that which you do not know.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="He taught Adam all the names, then He set them before the angels and said, &quot;Tell Me the names of these, if what you say be true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said, &quot;Glory be to You; we have no knowledge except whatever You have taught us. You are the All Knowing, the All Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Then He said, &quot;O Adam, tell them their names.&quot; When Adam had told them the names, God said to the angels, &quot;Did I not say to you: I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="When We said to the angels, &quot;Bow down before Adam,&quot; they all bowed except for Iblis [Satan]. He refused and acted proudly and became an unbeliever."/>
		<aya index="35" text="We said, &quot;O Adam! live with your wife in Paradise and eat freely from it anywhere you may wish. Yet do not approach this tree lest you become wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="But Satan caused them both to slip through this and thus brought about the loss of their former state. We said, &quot;Go down from here as enemies to each other; and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a while!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam received some words [of prayer] from his Lord and He accepted his repentance. He is the Forgiving One, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said, &quot;Go down, all of you, from here: then when guidance comes to you from Me, anyone who follows My guidance will have no fear, nor will they grieve --"/>
		<aya index="39" text="those who deny and reject Our signs shall be the inhabitants of the Fire; therein shall they abide forever.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Children of Israel, remember the favours I have bestowed upon you, and fulfil the covenant that you made with Me. I shall fulfil the covenant I made with you. Fear Me alone."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in the message I have sent down which fulfils that [predictions about the last prophet in their Scripture] which you already possess and do not be foremost among those who deny its truth. Do not sell My revelations for a paltry price; fear Me alone."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Do not mix truth with falsehood, or hide the truth when you know it."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Attend to your prayers, give the zakat [prescribed alms] and bow down with those who bow down."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Do you admonish others to do good and forget this yourselves? Yet you read the Book. Will you not then understand?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Seek help with patience and prayer; this is indeed an exacting discipline, but not to the humble,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="who know for certain that they will meet their Lord, and that they will return to Him."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I have bestowed on you, and how I favoured you above all other people."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Guard yourselves against the Day on which no soul shall in the least avail another, when neither intercession nor ransom shall be accepted from it nor shall help be given to it."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Remember when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who subjected you to grievous torment, slaying your sons and sparing only your daughters,  surely in that there was a great trial for you from your Lord,"/>
		<aya index="50" text="and when We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people, while you looked on."/>
		<aya index="51" text="We appointed for Moses forty nights [on Mount Sinai], and in his absence you took to worshipping the calf, and thus became transgressors."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Yet after that We pardoned you, so that you might be grateful."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Remember when We gave Moses the Scripture, and the criterion [to distinguish between right and wrong], so that you might be guided."/>
		<aya index="54" text="When Moses said to his people, &quot;O my people, you have indeed wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf; turn in repentance to your Creator and slay [the culprits] among you. That course is best for you in the sight of your Maker.&quot; He relented towards you. He is the Forgiving One, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Remember when you said, &quot;Moses, we will not believe in you until we see God with our own eyes,&quot; a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that you might be grateful."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Then We caused the clouds to provide shade for you and sent down for you manna and quails, saying, &quot;Eat the good things We have provided for you.&quot; Indeed, they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Remember when We said, &quot;Enter this land and eat freely wherever you will. Make your way through the gates, bowing down and saying, &quot;God! Forgive us our sins.&quot; We shall forgive you your sins and We shall give abundance to those who do good.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="But the wrongdoers changed the words to something other than what they had been told. So We sent down upon the transgressors a punishment from heaven, because they were disobedient."/>
		<aya index="60" text="When Moses prayed for water for his people, We said to him, &quot;Strike the rock with your staff!&quot; And there gushed out from it twelve springs. Each tribe knew its drinking-place. [We said], &quot;Eat and drink what God has provided and do not act wrongfully in the land, spreading corruption.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="When you said, &quot;Moses, we cannot bear to eat only one kind of food, so pray to your Lord to bring forth for us some of the earth's produce, its herbs and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and onions.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Would you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is better? Go to some town and there you will find all that you demand.&quot; Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them, and they incurred the wrath of God, for having rejected His signs, and they killed His prophets unjustly, because they were rebels and transgressors."/>
		<aya index="62" text="The believers, the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabaeans, all those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good deeds, will be rewarded by their Lord; they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="63" text="[Children of Israel], We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain high above you, saying, &quot;Hold fast to what We have given you and bear its contents in mind, so that you may guard yourselves [against evil].&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Yet after that you turned away, and but for God's grace and mercy, you would have surely been among the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="You are aware of those who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath, whereupon We said to them, &quot;Be as apes, despised!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="We made their fate an example to their own generation and to those who followed them and a lesson to those who fear God."/>
		<aya index="67" text="When Moses said to his people, &quot;God commands you to sacrifice a heifer,&quot; they said, &quot;Are you making a mockery of us?&quot; He answered, &quot;God forbid that I should be so ignorant!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said, &quot;Ask your Lord to make it clear to us what sort of heifer she should be.&quot; He answered, &quot;God says she should be neither too old nor too young, but in between, so do as you are commanded.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said, &quot;Call on your Lord for us, to show us what colour she should be.&quot; He answered, &quot;God says she should be a bright yellow heifer, pleasing to the eye.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said, &quot;Ask your Lord to make it clear to us the exact type of heifer she should be, for to us all heifers look alike. If God wills, we shall be rightly guided.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="Moses answered, &quot;Your Lord says, she should be a heifer which has not been yoked to plough the land or water the fields, a heifer free from any blemish.&quot; &quot;Now you have told us the truth,&quot; they answered, and they sacrificed it, though they would rather not have done it."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Then, when you [Israelites] killed someone and started to blame one another, God brought to light what you concealed,"/>
		<aya index="73" text="We said, &quot;Strike [the corpse] with a part of it.&quot; Thus God restores the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then your hearts became as hard as rock or even harder: for, there are rocks from which streams gush forth; and, there are some that cleave asunder and water flows out from them, while others fall down for fear of God. God is not unaware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Do you then hope that they will believe in you when some of them have already heard the word of God and then, after having understood it, they knowingly perverted it?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="When they meet the faithful, they say, &quot;We are believers.&quot; But when alone, they say to each other, &quot;Must you tell them what God has revealed to us? They will only use it to argue against you before your Lord! Have you no sense?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they not know that God knows all that they conceal and all that they disclose?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="There are among them unlettered people who have no real knowledge of the Scriptures, knowing only their own wishful thinking and following only conjecture."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands, and then declare, &quot;This is from God,&quot; in order to sell it for a paltry price. Woe to them because of what their own hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned."/>
		<aya index="80" text="They say, &quot;The Fire is not going to touch us, and [even if it does], it will only be for a few days!&quot; Say [to them], &quot;Have you received a promise from God, for God never breaks His promise, or do you attribute something to God which you do not know?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Truly, those who do evil and are encompassed by their misdeeds, shall be the inmates of the Fire. Therein they shall abide forever,"/>
		<aya index="82" text="but those who believe and do good works are the heirs of Paradise; there they shall abide forever."/>
		<aya index="83" text="Remember when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, &quot;Worship none but God and be good to your parents and to relatives and orphans and the needy. And speak kindly to people. Attend to your prayers and pay the zakat [prescribed alms].&quot; But with the exception of a few, you turned away [in aversion] and paid no heed."/>
		<aya index="84" text="When We made a covenant with you, We said, &quot;You shall not shed each other's blood, nor turn your people out of their homes.&quot; You consented to this and bore witness."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Yet, here you are, slaying one another and driving some of your own people from their homelands, aiding one another against them, committing sin and aggression; but if they came to you as captives, you would ransom them. Surely their very expulsion was unlawful for you. Do you believe in one part of the Book and deny another part of it? Those of you who act thus shall be rewarded with disgrace in this world and with a severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection. God is never unaware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Such are they who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="87" text="To Moses We gave the Book and sent a succession of messengers after him. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. But, whenever a messenger came to you with something which you did not desire, you grew arrogant, calling some liars and slaying others."/>
		<aya index="88" text="They say, &quot;Our hearts are impenetrably wrapped [against whatever you say],&quot; but God has rejected them for their denial; they have but little faith."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And now that a Book has come to them from God, fulfilling that [predictions about the final prophet in their scriptures] which is with them, they deny it, whereas previously they used to pray for victory against the disbelievers, yet when there came to them that which they recognized as the truth, they rejected it. God's rejection is the due of all who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="90" text="What they have sold their souls for is evil: to the denial of God's own revelation, grudging that He should reveal His bounty to whom He chooses from among His servants! They have incurred wrath upon wrath. Humiliating punishment awaits those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="91" text="When they are told, &quot;Believe in what God has revealed,&quot; they say, &quot;We believe in what was revealed to us,&quot; while they deny the truth in what has been sent down after that, even though it is the Truth, confirming that which they already have. Say, &quot;Why did you kill God's prophets in the past, if you were true believers?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Moses came to you with clear signs, but in his absence you worshipped the calf and became wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="93" text="When We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain above you saying, &quot;Hold firmly to what We have given you and listen,&quot; you said, &quot;We hear, but we disobey,&quot; and their hearts were filled with the love of the calf, because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth. Say, &quot;Evil is that to which your faith enjoins you if you are indeed believers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say, &quot;If God's abode of the Hereafter is for you alone, to the exclusion of all others, then wish for death, if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will never wish for death, because of what their own hands have sent on before them; God is fully aware of the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="You will find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even the polytheists. Any of them would wish to be given a life of a thousand years, though even such a long life would not save them from [Our] punishment; and God sees all that they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say, &quot;Anyone who is an enemy of Gabriel, who by God's leave has brought down to your heart [the Quran] fulfilling that [predictions about the last prophet in the earlier revelations] which precedes it, and is a guidance and good news for the faithful,"/>
		<aya index="98" text="whoever is an enemy of God, His angels, or His messengers, or of Gabriel or Michael, will surely find that God too is the enemy of those who deny the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We have sent down clear signs to you and no one will reject them except the wicked."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Why is it that, whenever they make a covenant, some of them cast it aside? Most of them do not believe."/>
		<aya index="101" text="Whenever a messenger from God has come to them, fulfilling that [predictions] which they already had, some of those to whom the Book was given have cast off the Book of God behind their backs as if they had no knowledge."/>
		<aya index="102" text="They pursued what the devils falsely attributed to the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon was not an unbeliever: it is the devils who are unbelievers. They taught people witchcraft, and that which was sent down to Harut and Marut, the two angels in Babylon. But these two taught no one until they had said, &quot;We are but a trial, therefore, do not disbelieve [in God's guidance].&quot; So men learnt from them that by which they caused discord between man and wife; but they harmed no one thereby, except by the command of God; [on the contrary], these people learned that which would harm them and do them no good, knowing full well that whoever acquired [this knowledge] would have no share in the Hereafter. Evil indeed was the [price] for which they sold their souls, if only they had known it."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And had they but believed and been mindful of God, His reward would have been far better for them, if they had but known it."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Believers, do not say to the Prophet, &quot;Ra'ina&quot; but say, &quot;Unzurna,&quot; and listen to him with attention. For those who deny the truth, there is a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="105" text="They who deny the truth from among the People of the Book, or from among those who associate partners with God, do not desire that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But God singles out for His grace whom He wills -- for God is limitless in His great bounty."/>
		<aya index="106" text="If We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We will replace it by a better one or one similar to it. Do you not know that God has power over all things?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God alone? And that there is no protector or helper for you besides God?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Do you [all] want to question your messenger just as Moses was questioned previously? Anyone who exchanges faith for unbelief has strayed from the right path."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many among the People of the Book wish, through envy, to lead you back to unbelief, now that you have embraced the faith and the truth has been made plain to them. But you should pardon them and bear with them until God gives His command. Truly, God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Attend to your prayers and pay the prescribed alms; any good you store up for yourselves, you will find it with God. Certainly, God sees what you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="They declare, &quot;None shall ever enter Heaven unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&quot; This is their own wishful thinking. [Prophet], say, &quot;Produce your evidence if you are telling the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Indeed, those who submit themselves to God and act righteously shall be rewarded by their Lord: they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say, &quot;The Christians have no ground to stand on,&quot; and the Christians say, &quot;The Jews have no ground to stand on.&quot; Yet they both recite the Book, and those who have no knowledge say the same; God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their disputes."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Who could be more wicked than someone who prevents God's name from being mentioned in His places of worship, and seeks to bring about their ruin, while it behoves these men to enter them with fear in their hearts? There is disgrace in store for them in this world and a great punishment in the next."/>
		<aya index="115" text="The East and the West belong to God. Whichever way you turn, there is the Face of God. God is all pervading and all knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="They say, &quot;God has taken a son.&quot; Glory be to Him! Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; all things are obedient to Him."/>
		<aya index="117" text="He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees something, He says only, &quot;Be!&quot; and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Those who are devoid of knowledge say, &quot;Why does God not speak to us or show us a sign?&quot; The same demand was made by those before them; their hearts are all alike. We have made the signs clear to those whose faith is firm."/>
		<aya index="119" text="We have sent you with the truth, bearing good news and giving warning. You will not be held accountable for the people of the Fire."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Neither the Christians nor the Jews will be pleased with you until you follow their ways. Say, &quot;God's guidance is the only true guidance.&quot; If you followed their desires after the knowledge which has come to you, you would not have any patron or supporter against God."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those whom We have given this Book follow it as it ought to be followed; it is they who [truly] believe in it; those who deny it will be the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Children of Israel, remember My favour which I have bestowed upon you, and how I preferred you above all other people;"/>
		<aya index="123" text="and fear a Day when no human being shall avail another. Nor shall ransom be accepted from any of them, nor shall intercession be of any use to them, and none shall be succoured."/>
		<aya index="124" text="When his Lord tested Abraham with certain commands and he fulfilled them, He said, &quot;I will make you a leader of men.&quot; Abraham asked, &quot;And what of my descendants?&quot; He answered, &quot;My covenant does not extend to the transgressors.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="125" text="And We made the House [the Ka'bah] a place of assembly and a sanctuary for mankind, [saying], &quot;Make the place where Abraham stood a place of worship.&quot; We commanded Abraham and Ishmael, &quot;Purify My House for those who walk round it, those who stay there for devotion, and those who bow down and prostrate themselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham prayed, &quot;My Lord, make this city a city of peace, and provide its inhabitants with fruits, such of them as believe in God and the Last Day.&quot; God said, &quot;As for those who deny the truth, I will grant them benefits for a short while and then subject them to the punishment of the Fire -- an evil destination.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Abraham and Ishmael were laying the foundations of the House, [they prayed], &quot;Our Lord, accept this from us; for You are All Hearing, All Knowing."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Lord, make us submissive to You; make of our descendants a nation that will submit to You. Teach us our rites of worship and turn to us with mercy; You are the Forgiving One and the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="129" text="Our Lord, send forth to them a messenger of their own to recite Your revelations to them, to teach them the Scripture and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise One.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="130" text="Who but a foolish man would turn away from the religion of Abraham? We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="When his Lord said to him, &quot;Surrender!&quot; he responded, &quot;I have surrendered to the Lord of the Universe,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="132" text="and Abraham enjoined his sons to do the same, as did Jacob, &quot;My sons, God has chosen this religion for you; so do not let death overtake you, except when you are in a state of submission.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="133" text="Were you present when Jacob faced the hour of death and he asked his sons, &quot;Who will you worship after me?&quot; They answered, &quot;We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac: the one God; we have submitted ourselves to Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="134" text="Those were a people that have passed away; what they did is theirs and what you have done is yours. You will not be answerable for their deeds."/>
		<aya index="135" text="They say, &quot;Be Jews or Christians, and you shall be rightly guided.&quot; Say, &quot;By no means! We believe in the faith of Abraham, who was ever inclined [to God]; he was not one of those who set up partners with God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say, &quot;We believe in God and what was revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the [other] prophets by their Lord.

Had God pleased, those who succeeded them would not have fought against one another after the clear signs had come to them. But they disagreed among themselves; some believed, while others did not. Yet had God willed, they would not have fought against one another; but God does whatever He wills."/>
		<aya index="254" text="Believers, spend out of what We have given you, before the Day comes when there will be neither trading, friendship nor intercession. Truly, it is those who deny the truth who are the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="255" text="God: there is no deity save Him, the Living, the Eternal One. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belong whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth. Who can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows all that is before them and all that is behind them. They can grasp only that part of His knowledge which He wills. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth; and their upholding does not weary Him. He is the Sublime, the Almighty One!"/>
		<aya index="256" text="There shall be no compulsion in religion: true guidance has become distinct from error. But whoever refuses to be led by Satan and believes in God has grasped the strong handhold that will never break. God is all hearing and all knowing."/>
		<aya index="257" text="God is the patron of the faithful. He leads them from darkness to the light. As for those who deny the truth, their supporter is Satan, who brings them out of light into darkness. They are the heirs of the Fire, and there they will remain forever."/>
		<aya index="258" text="Have you not heard of him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had bestowed the kingdom upon him? Abraham said, &quot;My Lord is the one who gives life and brings death.&quot; He answered, &quot;I [too] give life and bring death!&quot; Abraham said, &quot;God brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up yourself from the west.&quot; Then the disbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="259" text="Or of him who, when passing by a town the roofs of which had caved in, exclaimed, &quot;How will God restore it to life after its destruction?&quot; Thereupon God caused him to die, and after a hundred years, brought him back to life. God asked, &quot;How long have you remained in this state?&quot; He answered, &quot;I have remained a day or part of a day.&quot; God said, &quot;No, you have remained in this state for a hundred years. Now look at your food and your drink; they have not rotted. Look at your ass. We will make you a sign to mankind. Look at the bones -- how We set them together, then clothe them with flesh!&quot; When it had all become clear to him, he said, &quot;Now I know that God has power over all things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="260" text="When Abraham said, &quot;Show me, my Lord, how You revive the dead!&quot; God said, &quot;Do you not believe?&quot; Abraham answered, &quot;Yes, indeed I do believe, but just to reassure my heart.&quot; Then God said, &quot;Take four birds, and train them to come back to you. Then place them separately on each hilltop, and call them: they will come flying to you. Know that God is almighty and wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="261" text="Those who spend their wealth for God's cause may be compared to a grain of corn which sprouts into seven ears, with a hundred grains in each ear: for God grants manifold increase to whom He wills; God is infinite and all knowing."/>
		<aya index="262" text="Those who spend their wealth for God's cause and do not follow their almsgiving with taunts and insults shall be rewarded by their Lord; they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="263" text="A kind word and forgiveness is better than a charitable deed followed by hurtful words: God is self-sufficient and forbearing."/>
		<aya index="264" text="Believers, do not cancel out your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words, like one who spends his wealth only to be seen by people, and not believing in God and the Last Day. Such men are like a rock covered with earth: a shower falls upon it and leaves it hard and bare. They will gain nothing from their works. God does not guide those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="265" text="But those who spend their wealth in order to gain God's approval, and to strengthen their souls are like a garden on elevated ground. When heavy rain falls on it, it doubles its produce; and if heavy rain does not fall, then light rain suffices. God sees what you do."/>
		<aya index="266" text="Would any of you, being a man well advanced in age with helpless children to support, like to have a garden of dates and grapes, watered by rivers and containing all kinds of fruits, stricken by a fiery whirlwind and utterly scorched? Thus God makes His signs clear to you, so that you may reflect."/>
		<aya index="267" text="Believers, give charitably from the good things which you have earned and what We produce for you from the earth; not worthless things which you yourselves would only reluctantly accept. Know that God is self-sufficient and praiseworthy."/>
		<aya index="268" text="Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and commands you to do foul deeds. But God promises His forgiveness and His bounty. God is bountiful and all knowing."/>
		<aya index="269" text="He grants wisdom to whom He will; and whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted abundant wealth. Yet none bear this in mind except those endowed with understanding."/>
		<aya index="270" text="Whatever you spend and whatever vows you make are known to God, but the wrongdoers shall have no helpers."/>
		<aya index="271" text="If you give charity openly, it is good, but if you keep it secret and give to the needy in private, that is better for you, and it will atone for some of your bad deeds. God is aware of all that you do."/>
		<aya index="272" text="It is not your responsibility to make them follow the right path; God guides whomever He pleases. Whatever wealth you spend is to your own benefit, provided that you spend only to seek the favour of God. Whatever wealth you spend [for God's cause] shall be repaid to you in full and you shall not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="273" text="The needy, who are too engrossed in God's cause to be able to travel about the land in search of a livelihood, are considered by those who are unaware of their condition to be free from want, because they refrain from begging. But they can be known from their appearance. They do not make insistent demands upon people. Whatever wealth you spend, God knows it."/>
		<aya index="274" text="Those who spend their wealth night and day, both privately and publicly, will receive their reward from their Lord. They shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="275" text="Those who live on usury shall rise up before God like men whom Satan has demented by his touch; for they say, &quot;Buying and selling is only a kind of usury.&quot; But God has made trade lawful and made usury unlawful. Therefore, he who desists because of the admonition that has come to him from his Lord may retain what he has received in the past; and it will be for God to judge him. Those who revert to it shall be the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever."/>
		<aya index="276" text="God blights usury and blesses charitable deeds. God does not love the ungrateful wrongdoer."/>
		<aya index="277" text="Those who believe, do good deeds, attend to their prayers and engage in almsgiving, shall be rewarded by their Lord and shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="278" text="Believers, have fear of God, and give up what is still due to you from usury, if you are true believers."/>
		<aya index="279" text="For, if you do not do so, then know that you are at war with God and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may retain your capital. Do not wrong [others] and you will not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="280" text="If the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then grant him respite till a time of ease. If you were to write it off as an act of charity, that would be better for you, if only you knew."/>
		<aya index="281" text="Fear the Day when you shall be made to return to God; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="282" text="Believers, when you contract a debt for a stated term, put it down in writing; have a scribe write it down with fairness between you. No scribe should refuse to write: let him write as God has taught him, let the debtor dictate, and let him fear God, his Lord, and not diminish [the debt] at all. If the debtor is weak in mind or body, or unable to dictate, then in fairness let his guardian dictate for him. Call in two of your men as witnesses. But if two men cannot be found, then call one man and two women out of those you approve of as witnesses, so that if one of the two women should forget the other can remind her. Let the witnesses not refuse when they are summoned. Do not be disinclined to write down your debts, be they small or large, together with the date of payment. This is more just in the sight of God; it is more reliable as testimony, and more likely to prevent doubts arising between you, unless it be ready merchandise which you give or take from hand to hand, then it will not be held against you for not writing it down. Have witnesses present whenever you trade with one another, and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness, for if you did cause them harm, it would be a crime on your part. Be mindful of God; He teaches you: He has full knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="283" text="If you are on a journey and do not find any literate person, something should be handed over as security. If one of you entrusts another with something, let the trustee restore the pledge to its owner; and let him fear God, his Lord. Do not conceal testimony. If someone does conceal it, in his heart he commits a crime. God knows what you do."/>
		<aya index="284" text="All that the heavens and the earth contain belongs to God, whether you disclose what is in your minds or keep it hidden. God will bring you to account for it. He will forgive whom He will and punish whom He pleases: He has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="285" text="The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and [so do] believers. They all believe in God and His angels, His scriptures, and His messengers. They say, &quot;We do not differentiate between any of His messengers. We hear and obey. Grant us Your forgiveness, Lord, to You we shall all return!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="286" text="God does not charge a soul with more than it can bear. It shall be requited for whatever good and whatever evil it has done. [They pray], &quot;Our Lord, do not take us to task if we forget or make a mistake! Our Lord, do not place on us a burden like the one You placed on those before us! Our Lord, do not place on us a burden we have not the strength to bear! Pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy on us. You are our Lord and Sustainer, so help us against those who deny the truth.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="7" text="It is He who has sent down the Book to you. Some of its verses are clear and precise in meaning, they are the basis of the Book, while others are allegorical. Those with deviation in their hearts pursue the allegorical, so as to create dissension by seeking to explain it: but no one knows its meaning except God. Those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say, &quot;We believe in it: it is all from our Lord.&quot; But only the wise take heed."/>

		<aya index="12" text="Say to those who deny the truth, &quot;You shall be overcome and driven into Hell -- an evil resting place!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="There was a sign for you in the two groups which met face to face [at Badr], one party fighting for the cause of God and the other made up of those who deny the truth. The faithful saw with their own eyes that the others were twice their number: but God strengthens with His succour whom He wills. In this, there is indeed a lesson for all who have eyes to see."/>
		<aya index="14" text="The satisfaction of worldly desires through women, and children, and heaped-up treasures of gold and silver, and pedigreed horses, and cattle and lands is attractive to people. All this is the provision of the worldly life; but the most excellent abode is with God."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Say, &quot;Shall I tell you of something better than all of these? For the God-fearing, there are Gardens in nearness to their God with rivers flowing through them where they shall live forever with pure spouses and the goodwill of God. God is watching His servants --"/>

		<aya index="37" text="Her Lord graciously accepted her and made her grow in goodness and entrusted her to the care of Zachariah. Every time Zachariah visited her in her chamber he found some provision with her. He asked, &quot;Mary, where did this provision come from?&quot; She replied, &quot;This is from God. God provides for whoever He wills without measure.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="41" text="He said, &quot;My Lord, grant me a sign.&quot; [The angel] said, &quot;Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days except by signs. Remember your Lord much and glorify Him morning and evening.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="45" text="When the angels said, &quot;O Mary, your Lord gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, honoured in this world and in the next and one of those who are granted nearness to God."/>
		<aya index="46" text="And he shall speak to men in his cradle, and as a grown man, and shall be one of the righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="&quot;Lord,&quot; she said, &quot;how can I have a child when no man has touched me?&quot; [The angel] replied, &quot;Thus it is: God creates what He wills: when He wills a thing He need only say, &quot;Be,&quot; and it is."/>
		<aya index="48" text="God will instruct him in the Book and in wisdom and in the Torah and in the Gospel."/>
		<aya index="49" text="He will make him a messenger to the Children of Israel. He will say: &quot;I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. I will make the shape of a bird out of clay for you and then breathe into it and, by God's leave, it will become a living bird. And by God's leave I will heal the blind and the leper and bring the dead to life. I will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your homes. Surely in this there is a sign for you, if you are believers."/>
		<aya index="50" text="I come to fulfill [the prediction] of the Torah which preceded me and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you and I come to you with a sign from your Lord. So fear God and obey me."/>

		<aya index="55" text="God said, &quot;O Jesus, I shall take you to Me and will raise you up to Me and shall clear you [of the calumnies] of the disbelievers, and shall place those who follow you above those who deny the truth, until the Day of Judgement; then to Me shall all return and I will judge between you regarding your disputes."/>

		<aya index="65" text="People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham when the Torah and Gospel were only sent down after him. Do you not use your reason?"/>
		<aya index="66" text="You are those who disputed about things of which you had some knowledge. Must you now argue about things of which you have no knowledge? God knows, but you do not know."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. He was an upright man, one who had surrendered himself to God. He was not one of those who associate partners with God."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Surely, the people who are closest to Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet [Muhammad], and those who believe in him. God is the guardian of the believers."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Some of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray but they only lead themselves astray, though they do not realise it."/>
		<aya index="70" text="People of the Book! Why do you deny God's signs, having been witnesses thereof?"/>
		<aya index="71" text="People of the Book! Why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth?"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Some of the People of the Book say to one another, &quot;Believe in what is revealed to the faithful in the morning and deny it in the evening, so that they [the Muslims] may themselves abandon their faith [in confusion]."/>
		<aya index="73" text="Believe only in those who follow your own religion.&quot; Say to them, &quot;Surely, the true guidance is the guidance from God.&quot; [But you think it is impossible that] someone else may be granted [revelation] such as you were granted -- or else that they should contend against you before your Lord. Say, &quot;All grace is in the hands of God; He grants it to whom He wills: for God is boundless, and all knowing,"/>
		<aya index="74" text="He singles out for His mercy whoever He pleases. God is the Lord of exceeding bounty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="Among the people of the Book there are some who, if you entrust them with a heap of gold, will return it to you. But there are others of them who, if you entrust them with a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you keep demanding it from them. That is because they say, &quot;We are under no obligation towards the gentiles.&quot; They deliberately tell lies about God."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Indeed God loves those who honour their covenants and fear Him. God loves the righteous."/>
		<aya index="77" text="Those who sell out God's covenant and their oaths for a paltry price will have no share in the life to come on the Day of Resurrection. God will neither speak to them nor cast a look upon them on the Day of Judgement, nor will He purify them. For them there shall be a grievous punishment."/>
		<aya index="78" text="There are some among them who distort the Book by the way they speak to make you think that what they say is from the Book, whereas it is not. They say it is from God whereas it is not. Thus they tell a lie about God and they know it."/>
		<aya index="79" text="No one to whom God has given the Scriptures and on whom He has bestowed wisdom and prophethood would say to men, &quot;Worship me instead of God.&quot; [He would say rather], &quot;Be devoted servants of God, for you have taught and studied the Scriptures.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="Nor would he enjoin you to take the angels and the prophets as your lords; how could he command you to be disbelievers after you have submitted to God."/>
		<aya index="81" text="When God made a covenant with the prophets, He said, &quot;Here is the Book and the wisdom which I have given you. When there comes to you a messenger fulfilling that [predictions about him in their Scripture] which is with you, you must believe in him and help him. Do you then affirm this and accept the responsibility I have laid upon you in these terms?&quot; They said, &quot;We will affirm it.&quot; God said, &quot;Then bear witness, and I will bear witness with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="82" text="Now whoever turns away after this, are surely transgressors."/>
		<aya index="83" text="Do they seek a religion other than the religion of God, when everything in the heavens and the earth has submitted to Him, willingly or unwillingly? To Him they shall all return."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Say, &quot;We believe in God and in what has been sent down to us and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes. We believe in what has been given to Moses, Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. It is to Him that we have surrendered ourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="85" text="If anyone seeks a religion other than Islam [submission to God], it will not be accepted from him; he will be among the losers in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="86" text="How would God bestow His guidance upon people who have opted for unbelief after having embraced the faith and having borne witness that this Messenger is true and [after] all evidence of the truth has come to them? For, God does not guide such wrongdoers:"/>
		<aya index="87" text="such people will be rewarded with rejection by God, by the angels, by all mankind."/>
		<aya index="88" text="In this state they shall abide forever; their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be granted respite."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Except for those who afterwards repent and reform. God is forgiving and merciful;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="but as for those who are bent on denying the truth after accepting the true faith and grow in their refusal to acknowledge the truth, their repentance will not be accepted. They are the ones who have gone far astray."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Those who reject faith and die in the state of rejection will not be saved, even if they offer as ransom enough gold to fill the entire earth. Painful punishment is in store for them and they will have no supporters."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Never will you attain to righteousness unless you spend for the cause of God out of what you cherish; and whatever you spend is known to God."/>
		<aya index="93" text="All food was lawful for the Children of Israel, except whatever Israel had made unlawful for himself before the Torah was sent down. Say to them, &quot;Bring the Torah then and read it, if you are truthful."/>

So virtuous women are obedient and guard in the husband's absence what God would have them guard. As for those from whom you apprehend infidelity, admonish them, then refuse to share their beds, and finally hit them [lightly]. Then if they obey you, take no further action against them. For God is High, Great."/>

And let them also be on their guard, armed with their weapons. Those who deny the truth want you to be negligent of your arms and your baggage, so that they may fall upon you suddenly.

God has prepared a humiliating punishment for those who deny the truth."/>

		<aya index="170" text="Mankind! The Messenger has brought you the truth from your Lord, so believe for your own good. And if you deny the truth, know that to God belongs all that the heavens and the earth contain. God is all knowing and wise."/>
		<aya index="171" text="People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your religion. Say nothing but the truth about God. The Christ Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of God and His word, conveyed to Mary, a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not say: &quot;There are three [gods].&quot; Desist, it will be better for you. Indeed, God is the one and only God. His Holiness is far above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And God is sufficient as a guardian."/>
		<aya index="172" text="Surely, the Messiah would never disdain to be accounted a servant of God. Nor would the angels who are nearest to Him. If any do disdain to worship Him, and grow arrogant, He will in any case gather them all before Him."/>
		<aya index="173" text="Those who believe and do good works will be fully recompensed by Him. And He will give them yet more out of His bounty; and as for those who were disdainful and proud, He will punish them with a painful punishment. And they will not find anyone to help or protect them against God."/>
		<aya index="174" text="Men, you have received clear evidence from your Lord. We have sent down a clear light to you."/>
		<aya index="175" text="As for those who believe in God and hold fast to Him, He will admit them to His mercy and His grace; He will guide them towards Him on a straight path."/>
		<aya index="176" text="They ask you for instruction. Say, &quot;God instructs you concerning the indirect heirs. If a person dies childless but has a sister, she receives half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she dies childless. If there are two sisters, they receive two-thirds of what he leaves. If there are brothers and sisters, the share of each male shall be that of two females. God makes things clear to you, so that you will not go astray. God has knowledge of all things.&quot;"/>

	<sura index="5" name="المائدة">
		<aya index="1" text="Believers, fulfill your obligations. All livestock is lawful for you, other than that which is hereby announced to you. You are forbidden to kill game while you are on a pilgrimage -- God commands what He will."/>
		<aya index="2" text="Believers, violate neither the sanctity of God's signs, the Sacred Month, the sacrificial animals, the animals wearing garlands [indicating they are to be sacrificed] nor those on their way to the Sacred House seeking the bounty and pleasure of their Lord. When, on completion of your pilgrimage, you take off the garb of the pilgrim, you may hunt. Do not let the enmity of those who barred you from the Sacred Mosque lead you into sin. Help one another in goodness and in piety. Do not help one another in sin and transgression. Fear God! God is severe in punishment."/>
		<aya index="3" text="You are forbidden carrion, blood and pork; and any flesh over which the name of any other than God is invoked; and any creature which has been strangled, or killed by a blow or in a fall, or has been gored to death or half-eaten by a wild animal, saving that which you make lawful [by slaughtering properly while it was still alive] and what has been slaughtered at an altar. You are forbidden to make the division of [meat] by means of divining arrows: that is sinful conduct. Those who deny the truth have this day despaired of ever harming your religion. So do not fear them. Fear Me. Today I have completed your religion for you and completed My blessing upon you. I have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if anyone is forced by hunger to eat something which is forbidden, not intending to commit a sin, he will find God forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="4" text="If they ask you what has been made lawful for them, say, &quot;All good things have been made lawful for you;&quot; and what you have taught your birds and beasts of prey to catch, training them as God has taught you. So eat what they catch for you, but first pronounce God's name over it. Fear God, for God is swift in taking account."/>
		<aya index="5" text="Today, all good things have been made lawful to you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them. The chaste believing women and the chaste women of the people who were given the Book before you, are lawful to you, provided that you give them their dowers, and marry them, neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses. The deeds of anyone who rejects the faith will come to nothing, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Believers, when you rise to pray, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows and wipe your heads and [wash] your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of impurity, take a full bath. But if you are sick or on a journey or when you have just relieved yourselves, or you have consorted with your spouses, you can find no water, take some clean sand and rub your faces and hands with it. God does not wish to place any burden on you; He only wishes to purify you and perfect His favour to you, in order that you may be grateful."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Remember God's favour to you, and the covenant, which He made with you when you said, &quot;We hear and we obey.&quot; Fear God. God has full knowledge of the innermost thoughts of men."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearer to being God-fearing. Fear God. God is aware of all that you do."/>
		<aya index="9" text="God has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward;"/>
		<aya index="10" text="but those who deny the truth and deny Our signs are destined for Hell."/>
		<aya index="11" text="Believers, remember the blessings which God bestowed upon you when a certain people were about to lay hands on you and He held back their hands from you. Have fear of God and in God let the believers place their trust."/>
		<aya index="12" text="God made a covenant with the Children of Israel; and raised among them twelve leaders. God said, &quot;Surely, I am with you. If you attend to your prayers and pay the alms and believe in My messengers and support them, and give a generous loan to God, I will certainly forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens through which rivers flow. Whoever among you denies the truth after this shall go astray from the straight path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Since they broke their solemn pledge, We laid on them Our curse and hardened their hearts. They distorted the meaning of the revealed words, taking them out of their context, and forgot much of what they were enjoined. You will constantly discover treachery on their part, except for a few of them. But pardon them, and bear with them; truly, God loves the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="14" text="We also made a covenant with those who say, &quot;We are Christians.&quot; But they too have forgotten much of what they were enjoined. So, We have put enmity and hatred between them till the Day of Judgement; and soon God will declare to them what they have been doing."/>
		<aya index="15" text="People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to make clear to you much of what you have hidden of the Scriptures and to forgive you much. A light has now come to you from God and a clear Book,"/>
		<aya index="16" text="whereby God guides to the ways of peace all who seek His good pleasure, bringing them from darkness to the light, by His will, and guiding them to a straight path."/>
		<aya index="17" text="In blasphemy indeed are those who say, &quot;God is Christ, the son of Mary.&quot; Say, &quot;Who then could prevent God if He so willed from destroying Christ, son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth? The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything between them belong to God. He creates what He will and God has power over all things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="The Jews and the Christians say, &quot;We are the children of God and His beloved ones.&quot; Say, &quot;Then why does He punish you for your sins? Indeed, you are but human beings among those He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, belong to God and all shall return to Him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="People of the Book, Our Messenger has come to you to make things clear to you after an interval between the messengers, lest you say, &quot;No bearer of glad tidings and no warner has come to us.&quot; So a bearer of glad tidings and a warner has indeed come to you. God has the power to do all things."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Remember when Moses said to his people, &quot;O my people! Remember God's favour to you, He has raised up prophets among you, made you kings, and granted you [favours] such as He has not granted to anyone else in the world."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O my people! Enter the holy land which God has assigned  for you. Do not turn back, or you will be the losers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="They said, &quot;Moses, in that land there is a powerful people. Never shall we enter it until they leave it: if they leave, then we shall certainly enter it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="Thereupon two God-fearing men whom God had blessed said, &quot;Go into them through the gate -- for as soon as you enter, you shall surely be victorious! Put your trust in God if you are true believers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="They said, &quot;We will never enter it, Moses, as long as they are there. Go, you and your Lord, and fight, and we will stay here.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Moses supplicated, &quot;Lord, I have power over none but myself and my brother; so separate us from the disobedient people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="God said, &quot;The land is forbidden to them for forty years, while they wander around the earth, bewildered; do not grieve over these wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Relate to them, the true story of the two sons of Adam. When they both presented an offering, it was accepted from one of them and not from the other. The latter said, &quot;I shall kill you!&quot; The former said, &quot;God accepts [things] only from the righteous."/>
		<aya index="28" text="If you raise your hand to kill me, I will not raise mine to kill you. I fear God, the Lord of the Universe,"/>
		<aya index="29" text="and I want you to bear your sins against me as well as your own sins and become an inhabitant of the Fire. Such is the reward of the wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="His lower self persuaded him to kill his brother, and he killed him and he became one of the lost."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Then God sent a raven, which scratched the earth, so that He might show him how to hide the corpse of his brother. &quot;Alas!&quot; he cried, &quot;Am I not able even to be like this raven, so that I may hide the corpse of my brother?&quot; And he repented."/>
		<aya index="32" text="That was why We laid it down for the Children of Israel that whoever killed a human being, except as a punishment for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, shall be regarded as having killed all mankind, and that whoever saved a human life shall be regarded as having saved all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, but many of them continued to commit excesses in the land."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Those that make war against God and His Messenger and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or be banished from the country. They shall be disgraced in this world, and then severely punished in the Hereafter,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="except for those who repent before you gain power over them: for you must know that God is forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Believers, fear God and seek ways to come closer to Him and strive for His cause, so that you may prosper."/>
		<aya index="36" text="As for those who reject Faith, if they had everything on earth, and twice as much again and offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them -- they will have a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="37" text="They will want to get out of the Fire but they will be unable to do so: theirs shall be a lasting punishment."/>
		<aya index="38" text="Cut off the hands of thieves, whether they are male or female, as a [deterrent] punishment from God for what they have done. God is almighty and wise."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But God will surely turn in mercy to him who repents after his transgression and reforms. Surely, God is most forgiving and ever merciful."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to God? He punishes whom He will and forgives whom He pleases. God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Messenger, do not be grieved by those who vie with one another in denying the truth; those who say with their tongues, &quot;We believe,&quot; but have no faith in their hearts; from among the Jews also, there are those who listen eagerly to any lies. They listen to you to convey to others [religious leaders] who do not come to you [out of pride and conceit]. They [these leaders] take words out of their context and say, &quot;If this be given to you, receive it, but if not, then beware!&quot; If anyone's trial is intended by God, you cannot in the least prevail against God on his behalf. Those whose hearts God does not intend to purify shall be subjected to disgrace in this world and a severe punishment in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="42" text="They listen eagerly to falsehood, and devour forbidden things voraciously. If they come to you, then judge between them or avoid them. If you avoid them, they can in no way harm you, but if you do judge, judge them with fairness: God loves those that deal justly."/>
		<aya index="43" text="But why do they come to you for judgement when they have the Torah, which enshrines God's own judgement? Yet, in spite of that, they turn their backs; and certainly they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="44" text="We have revealed the Torah, in which there is guidance and light. By it the prophets who were obedient to Us judged the Jews, and so did the rabbis and the priests, according to God's Book which had been entrusted to their care; and to which they were witnesses. Have no fear of man; fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a paltry sum. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are deniers of truth."/>
		<aya index="45" text="We prescribed for them in [the Torah]: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and a wound for a wound. But, if anyone forgoes it, this shall be for him an expiation. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are wrongdoers!"/>
		<aya index="46" text="We caused Jesus, son of Mary to follow in their footsteps, fulfilling what had been revealed before him in the Torah. We gave him the Gospel, which contained guidance and light, fulfilling what was revealed before it in the Torah: a guide and an admonition to the God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Therefore, let those who follow the Gospel judge according to what God has revealed in it. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are rebellious."/>
		<aya index="48" text="We have sent down the Book to you with the truth, fulfilling [the predictions] revealed in the previous scriptures and determining what is true therein, and as a guardian over it. Judge, therefore, between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their vain desires turning away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you We have ordained a law and a way, and had God so willed, He would have made you all a single community, but He did not so will, in order that He might try you by what He has given you. Vie, then, with one another in doing good works; to God you shall all return; then He will make clear to you about what you have been disputing."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Judge between them by what God has sent down and do not be led by their desires. Beware of them lest they turn you away from a part of that what God has revealed to you. If they reject your judgement, know that God intends to punish them for the sins they have committed. Indeed a large number of the people are disobedient."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Is it pagan laws that they wish to be judged by? Who is a better judge than God for men whose faith is firm?"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Believers, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies. They are allies with one another. Whoever of you takes them as an ally shall become one of them. God does not guide the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="52" text="You will see those whose minds are diseased hastening towards them, saying, &quot;We fear lest a misfortune befall us.&quot; But God may well bring about victory or make a decision which is favourable to you. Then they will repent of the thoughts, which they secretly harboured in their hearts."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Then the believers will say, &quot;Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by God, that they were with you?&quot; Their works will come to nothing and they will lose all."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Believers, if any among you renounce the faith, God will replace them by others who love Him and are loved by Him, who will be kind and considerate towards believers and firm and unyielding towards those who deny the truth. They will strive hard for the cause of God and will in no way take to heart the reproaches of the fault finder. Such is God's bounty, which He gives to anyone He wishes. God is bountiful and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Your helpers are only God and His Messenger and the believers who say their prayers and pay the alms and bow down in worship."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Those who ally themsleves with God, His Messenger, and the believers must know that God's party is sure to triumph."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Believers! Do not seek the friendship of those who were given the Book before you or the disbelievers who ridicule your religion and make a jest of it. Have fear of God, if you are true believers."/>
		<aya index="58" text="When you call them to prayer, they treat it as a jest and a diversion. This is because they are devoid of understanding."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Say, &quot;People of the Book! Do you resent us only because we believe in God and in what has been revealed to us and to others before, and because most of you are disobedient?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Say, &quot;Shall I tell you who will receive a worse reward from God? Those whom God has rejected and with whom He has been angry. They were condemned as apes and swine and those who worship the evil. These are in the worst plight and farthest astray from the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="When they come to you they say, &quot;We believe,&quot; but they come [with the resolve] to deny the truth and leave in the same state. God knows best what they are concealing."/>
		<aya index="62" text="You see many among them vie with one another in sin and transgression and practice what is unlawful. It is vile indeed what they have been doing!"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them to utter sinful words or to consume what is unlawful? Their actions are indeed vile."/>
		<aya index="64" text="The Jews say, &quot;The hand of God is tied up.&quot; May their own hands be tied up and may they be cursed for what they say. No indeed! His hands are both outstretched: He bestows as He will. What is revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase in most of them their obstinate rebellion and denial of truth; and We have sown among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, God puts it out. They spread evil in the land, but God does not love the evil-doers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="If only the People of the Book would believe and be mindful of God, We would surely pardon their sins and We would surely admit them into the Gardens of Bliss."/>
		<aya index="66" text="If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to them from their Lord, they would surely have been nourished from above and from below. There are some among them who are on the right course; but there are many among them who do nothing but evil."/>
		<aya index="67" text="O Messenger, deliver whatever has been sent down to you by your Lord. If you do not do so, you will not have conveyed His message. God will defend you from mankind. For God does not guide those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Say, &quot;People of the Book, you have no ground to stand on until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what is revealed to you from your Lord.&quot; What is revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in rebellion and in their denial of the truth. But do not grieve for those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Believers, Jews, Sabaeans and Christians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does what is right, shall have nothing to fear nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="70" text="We made a covenant with the Children of Israel and sent forth messengers among them. But whenever a messenger came to them with a message that was not to their liking, some they accused of lying, while others they put to death,"/>
		<aya index="71" text="and they imagined that no harm would come to them; and so they became blind and deaf [of heart]. God turned to them in mercy; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. God is fully aware of their actions."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Indeed, they are deniers of the truth who say, &quot;God is the Christ, the son of Mary.&quot; For the Christ himself said, &quot;Children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord.&quot; If anyone associates anything with God, God will forbid him the Garden and the Fire will be his home. The wrongdoers shall have no helpers."/>
		<aya index="73" text="They are deniers of the truth who say, &quot;God is one of three.&quot; There is only One God. If they do not desist from so saying, a painful punishment is bound to befall such of them as are bent on denying the truth."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Why do they not turn to God and ask for His forgiveness? God is forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Christ, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. Many messengers passed away before him. His mother was a virtuous woman; and they both ate food [like other mortals]. See how We make the signs clear to them! See how they turn away!"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Say, &quot;Do you worship something other than God, that has no power to do you harm or good? God alone is the All Hearing and All Knowing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Say, &quot;People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your religion and do not follow the whims of those who went astray before you -- they caused many to go astray and themselves strayed away from the right path.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Those of the Children of Israel who were bent on denying the truth were cursed by David and Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and were given to transgression;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="they would not prevent one another from doing the wrong things they did. Evil indeed were their deeds."/>
		<aya index="80" text="You see many among them allying themselves with those who deny the truth. Evil is that which their souls have sent on ahead for them. They have incurred the wrath of God and shall suffer eternal punishment."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Had they believed in God and the Prophet and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken those who deny the truth as their allies, but many of them are disobedient."/>
		<aya index="82" text="You will find that the bitterest in their enmity to the faithful are the Jews and the polytheists; the nearest in affection to them are those who say, &quot;We are Christians.&quot; That is because there are priests and monks among them; and because they are free from pride."/>
		<aya index="83" text="When they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears, because of the Truth they recognize. They say, &quot;Our Lord, we believe, so count us among those who bear witness."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Why should we not believe in God and in the truth that has come down to us? We yearn for our Lord to admit us among the righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="85" text="And for their words God will reward them with Gardens through which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. That is the reward of those who do good."/>
		<aya index="86" text="But those who deny the truth and deny Our signs will become the inmates of Hell."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Believers, do not forbid the wholesome good things, which God made lawful to you. Do not transgress; God does not love the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Eat the lawful and wholesome things, which God has given you. Fear God, in whom you believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="God will not call you to account for your meaningless oaths, but He will call you to account for the oaths, which you swear in earnest. The expiation for a broken oath is the feeding of ten needy men with such food as you normally offer to your own people; or the clothing of ten needy men; or the freeing of one slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days. That is the expiation of your breaking the oaths that you have sworn. Do keep your oaths. Thus God explains to you His commandments, so that you may be grateful."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Believers, intoxicants and gambling and [occult dedication of] stones and divining arrows are abominations devised by Satan. Avoid them, so that you may prosper."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Satan seeks to sow enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and gambling, and to keep you from the remembrance of God and from your prayers. Will you not then abstain?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Obey God and obey the Messenger, and be ever on your guard [against evil]. But if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger's duty is only to deliver the message clearly."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Those who believe and do good deeds will not be blamed for what they may have consumed [in the past], so long as they fear God and believe in Him and do good works; so long as they fear God and believe in Him, so long as they fear God and do good deeds. For God loves those who do good."/>
		<aya index="94" text="Believers, God will test you with game which come within the reach of your hands and spears, so that He may know those who fear Him, even if they cannot see Him. Anyone who oversteps the limits after this will have a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="95" text="Believers, do not kill any game while you are on a pilgrimage. Anyone of you who kills game deliberately shall make compensation with an animal which is the equivalent of what he has killed, to be determined by two just men from among you, as an offering brought to the Ka'bah; or he shall, in expiation, either feed the poor or do the equivalent of that in fasting, so that he may taste the consequence of his deeds. God forgives what is past, but if anyone relapses into wrongdoing, God will exact His retribution. God is mighty, the Lord of retribution."/>
		<aya index="96" text="To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you, a provision made for you and for seafarers. But you are forbidden the game of the land while you are on a pilgrimage. Have fear of God, before whom you shall all be gathered."/>
		<aya index="97" text="God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support as well as the sacred month and the sacrificial animals with their garlands. That is so that you may know that God has knowledge of whatever is in the heavens and on the earth and that He is fully aware of all things."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Know that God is severe in punishment, yet most forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="99" text="The Messenger's sole duty is to convey the message. God knows what you reveal and what you hide."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Say, &quot;The bad and the good are not alike, even though the abundance of the bad may appear pleasing to you. So fear God, O men of understanding, so that you may prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Believers, do not ask questions about things which, if they were made known to you, would only become burdensome for you; but if you ask them when the Quran is being revealed, they shall be made plain to you -- God has kept silent about them: God is most forgiving and forbearing."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Other people before you enquired about such things, but when they were disclosed to them, they refused to carry them out."/>
		<aya index="103" text="God has ordained no sanctity about animals described as bahirah, or sa'ibah, or wasilah or ham. Those who deny the truth invent falsehoods about God. Most of them do not use their reason:"/>
		<aya index="104" text="when it is said to them, &quot;Come to what God has sent down and to the Messenger.&quot; They reply, &quot;The faith we have inherited from our fathers is sufficient for us.&quot; Even though their forefathers knew nothing and were not guided!"/>
		<aya index="105" text="Believers, take care of your own souls. The misguided cannot harm you as long as you are guided. All of you will return to God. Then He will make you realize that which you used to do."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Believers, when death approaches you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses when you make your testaments; or two men from another tribe, if the calamity of death overtakes you while you are travelling in the land. Detain them after prayers, and if you doubt their honesty, let them swear by God, &quot;We will not sell our testimony for any price, even to a kinsman. And we will not conceal the testimony of God. If we did, we would indeed be guilty of sin.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="107" text="If it turns out that both prove dishonest, two others should take their place from amongst those whose rights have been usurped and let them swear by God, saying, &quot;Our testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two. And we have not been guilty of any misstatement for then indeed we would be transgressors.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="70" text="Leave alone those for whom religion is only a sport and pastime and are deceived by the life of this world, but continue to remind them with the Quran, lest a soul be held in pledge because of what it has wrought, having no helper or intercessor besides God.

Such are those that are damned by their own actions: they will have boiling water to drink and a painful punishment for their denial of truth."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Say, &quot;Instead of God, shall we call upon that which can neither benefit us nor harm us? Are we to turn upon our heels after God has guided us, like one who, beguiled by devils in the land, wanders bewildered, his companions calling him to the right path, saying, &quot;Come to us&quot;?&quot; Say, &quot;God's guidance is the only guidance.

		<aya index="88" text="This is the guidance of God: He gives that guidance to whichever of His servants He pleases. If they had associated other deities with Him, surely all they did would have been of no avail."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Those are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood. If these people [the Makkans] reject it, We shall entrust it to a people who will never refuse to acknowledge it."/>

You have been taught things that neither you nor your forefathers had known before.&quot; Say, &quot;God has sent it;&quot; then leave them toying away with their speculation."/>
		<aya index="92" text="This is a blessed Book which We have revealed, confirming what came before it, so that you may warn the Mother of Cities [Makkah] and the people around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter do believe in it, and they are ever-mindful of their prayers."/>

		<aya index="122" text="Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he could walk among people be like him who is in utter darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus the deeds of those who deny the truth have been made fair-seeming to them."/>

		<aya index="128" text="On the day when He gathers them all together, He will say, &quot;Company of jinn, you took away many followers among mankind.&quot; And their adherents among mankind will say, &quot;Our Lord, we benefited from one another, but now we have reached the end of the term which You determined for us.&quot; He will say, &quot;The Fire shall be your home, and there you shall remain forever, except as God wills. Surely your Lord is wise and all knowing."/>
		<aya index="129" text="And in like manner We shall keep the wrongdoers close to others as a punishment for their misdeeds."/>
		<aya index="130" text="Company of jinn and mankind! Did messengers not come from among you to recite My revelations to you, and warn you of the meeting of this Day?&quot; They will say, &quot;We bear witness against ourselves.&quot; It was the life of this world that deceived them and so they will bear witness against themselves, that they rejected the truth."/>
		<aya index="131" text="Your Lord would not destroy a community for its wrongdoing, so long as its people were still unaware."/>
		<aya index="132" text="For all are degrees of rank according to their deeds; your Lord is not unaware of anything they do."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Your Lord is the self-sufficient One, the merciful. If He wills, He can take you away and replace you by anyone He pleases, just as He raised you from the offspring of other people."/>
		<aya index="134" text="That which you are promised shall surely come to pass and you cannot prevent it."/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say, &quot;O my people! Go on acting in your way; indeed I am going to act in my way; soon you will know whose end will be best in the Hereafter.&quot; Surely, the wrongdoers shall not prosper."/>
		<aya index="136" text="They set aside for God a share in what He has produced, such as crops and livestock, and they say, &quot;This is for God,&quot; so they claim!, and &quot;this is for our associate-gods?&quot; Their associate-gods' share does not reach God, whereas God's share reaches their associate-gods. How ill they judge!"/>
		<aya index="137" text="And in like manner, their associate gods have made killing their children seem fair to many pagans, so that they may ruin them and cause confusion in their religion. Had God pleased, they would not have done so; so leave them to their false inventions."/>
		<aya index="138" text="They also say, &quot;These animals and these crops are forbidden. None may eat them except those we permit.&quot; So they claim! There are some animals they exempt from labour and some over which they do not pronounce God's name, thus committing a sin against Him. He will requite them for the falsehoods they invent."/>
		<aya index="139" text="They say, &quot;What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is exclusively for our males and is forbidden to our females. But if it is stillborn, they may have a share of it.&quot; God will soon punish them for their [false] attribution. He is wise, and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="140" text="Losers indeed are they who kill their children foolishly and without knowledge and declare as forbidden what God has provided for them as sustenance -- a fabrication against God: they have gone astray and have not chosen to be rightly guided."/>
		<aya index="141" text="It is He who has produced gardens, both trellised and untrellised, and date palms and field crops, all varying in taste, and the olive and the pomegranate, both similar and dissimilar. Eat their fruits when they bear fruit and give away what is due of them on the day of their harvest. Do not waste anything. He does not love the wasteful!"/>
		<aya index="142" text="Of the cattle there are some for carrying burdens and some for food. Eat what God has provided for you and do not follow in Satan's footsteps, for he is a declared enemy of yours."/>
		<aya index="143" text="God has created four kinds of livestock of either sex: two of sheep and two of goats. Ask them, &quot;Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me on the basis of knowledge, if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="144" text="Again, of the camels there are two, and of the oxen two. Ask them, &quot;Is it the two males He has forbidden, or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you present when God enjoined this on you?&quot; Who is more unjust than one who, without knowledge, fabricates a lie against God, so that he may lead people astray without knowledge? Surely, God does not guide the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="145" text="Say [O Prophet], &quot;In all that has been revealed to me, I do not find a ban on anything to eat, except for carrion, flowing blood and pork, all these being unclean or profane, on which the name of someone other than God has been invoked.&quot; But if anyone is forced by necessity, being neither disobedient nor exceeding the limit, then surely your Lord is most forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="146" text="We forbade the Jews all animals with claws and the fat of sheep [and goats] and oxen, except what is on their backs and in their intestines and what adheres to their bones. That is the penalty We imposed on them for their disobedience. And We assuredly are true to Our word."/>
		<aya index="147" text="So, if they accuse you of lying, say, &quot;The mercy of your Lord is all-encompassing. His punishment cannot be averted from sinful men.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="148" text="Those who associate partners with God will surely say, &quot;Had God pleased, neither we nor our fathers would have served other gods besides Him; nor would we have made anything unlawful.&quot; Likewise those who lived before them argued falsely until they came to taste Our punishment! Say, &quot;Have you any knowledge? If so, produce it before us. You follow nothing but conjecture. You are merely guessing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="149" text="Say, &quot;God alone has the conclusive proof. If He had willed, He could have guided every one of you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="150" text="Say, &quot;Come, bring your witnesses, who can testify that God forbade [all] this.&quot; If they bear witness [falsely], do not bear witness with them; nor yield to the wishes of those who deny Our signs, nor of those who do not believe in the life to come and set up others as equals with their Lord."/>
		<aya index="151" text="Say, &quot;Come! I will tell you what your Lord has really forbidden you! Do not associate anything with Him; be good to your parents; and do not kill your children for fear of poverty, We shall provide sustenance for you as well as for them, refrain from committing indecent deeds, whether openly or in secret; and do not kill the life which God has made sacred, save by right. That is what He has enjoined upon you, so that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="152" text="Stay well away from an orphan's property, except with the best intentions, before he comes of age. Give full measure and weight, according to justice, We never charge a soul with more than it can bear, when you speak, observe justice, even though it concerns a close relative; and fulfil the covenants of God. That is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may take heed."/>
		<aya index="153" text="[He has enjoined], &quot;This is My straight path; so follow it, and do not follow other ways: that will lead you away from His path.&quot; That is what He enjoins upon you, so that you may guard yourselves."/>
		<aya index="154" text="Then We gave Moses the Book, completing [Our favour] to the righteous, explaining everything clearly, as guidance and mercy, so that they might believe in meeting their Lord."/>
		<aya index="155" text="This is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing, follow it and fear your Lord, so that you may receive mercy,"/>
		<aya index="156" text="and not say, &quot;The Book was only sent down to the two groups before us and we were indeed unaware of their teachings,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="157" text="or you may say, &quot;If the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have followed its guidance better than they did.&quot; There has now come to you clear evidence from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who, then, is more unjust than one who rejects the signs of God and turns away from them? We shall requite those who turn away from Our signs with a painful punishment, for their turning away."/>
		<aya index="158" text="Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come down to them, or for some of your Lord's signs to come? The day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, it shall not profit any human being who did not believe before, or who did not do any good by his faith. Say to them, &quot;Wait then, we too are waiting.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="159" text="Have nothing to do with those who have split up their religion into sects. Their case rests with God; He will tell them about what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="160" text="Whoever does a good deed will be repaid tenfold, but those who do a bad deed will only be repaid with its equivalent and they shall not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="161" text="Say, &quot;My Lord has guided me to a straight path, and to an upright religion, the religion of Abraham the upright, who was not of those who associate partners with God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="162" text="Say, &quot;My prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are all for God, the Lord of the worlds;"/>
		<aya index="163" text="He has no partner. So am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="164" text="Say, &quot;Shall I seek a lord other than God, while He is the Lord of all things?&quot; Everyone must bear the consequence of what he does, and no bearer of a burden can bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord you will return, and He will inform you of what you used to dispute about."/>
		<aya index="165" text="It is He who has made you successors [of others] on the earth and has exalted some of you over the others in degrees of rank, so that He may test you by that which He has given you. Your Lord is swift in punishment; yet surely He is forgiving, and merciful."/>

		<aya index="48" text="Satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said, &quot;None of the people shall prevail against you this day; I shall be your protector!&quot; But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, saying, &quot;This is where I leave you: I see what you do not, and I fear God -- God is severe in His punishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="The hypocrites and those whose hearts were perverted said, &quot;These people [the believers] must be deluded by their religion.&quot; But he who places his trust in God [knows that], God is Almighty and Wise."/>

		<aya index="1" text="This is a declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to the polytheists, with whom you had made agreements."/>
		<aya index="2" text="So go about in the land for four months, but know that you cannot frustrate the plan of God and that God will disgrace those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="3" text="This is a proclamation from God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Pilgrimage, that God is free of all obligation to the polytheists, and so is His Messenger. If you repent, it will be better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot frustrate the plan of God. Proclaim a grievous punishment to those who are bent on denying the truth."/>
		<aya index="4" text="As for those who have honoured the treaty you made with them and who have not supported anyone against you: fulfill your agreement with them to the end of their term. God loves those who are righteous."/>
		<aya index="5" text="When the forbidden months have passed, kill the polytheists [who are at war with you] wherever you find them. Take them captive, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent, and take to prayer regularly and pay the alms, then let them go their way. God is forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="If any one of the polytheists seeks asylum with you, grant him asylum so that he may hear the word of God; then convey him to a place of safety. That is because they are a people who have no knowledge."/>
		<aya index="7" text="How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of God and His Messenger, except for those with whom you entered into a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they act straight with you, act straight with them. God loves those who are righteous."/>
		<aya index="8" text="How [can there be a treaty] for, if they get the upper hand over you, they will respect neither kinship nor covenant. They [try to] please you with their tongues but their hearts reject you; most of them are perfidious."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They have sold God's revelations for a paltry price, and barred others from His path. How evil is what they have been doing!"/>
		<aya index="10" text="Where believers are concerned, they respect no tie of kinship or treaty. They are people who overstep the limits."/>
		<aya index="11" text="If they repent and keep up their prayers and pay the alms, then they are your brethren in faith. We make Our messages clear for people who are willing to learn."/>
		<aya index="12" text="But if they break faith after pledging it and revile your religion, then fight these leaders of unbelief, so that they may desist, for they have no regard for their pledged word."/>
		<aya index="13" text="Will you not fight against those who have broken their oaths and conspired to banish the Messenger? They were the first to attack you. Do you fear them? Surely God is more deserving of your fear, if you are true believers."/>
		<aya index="14" text="Fight them: God will punish them at your hands, and will disgrace them. He will help you to overcome them and heal the hearts of the faithful;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="He will remove the rage from their hearts. God will turn in His mercy to whom He wills. God is all knowing and wise."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Do you [O believers] think that you will be spared without God identifying which of you have struggled and did not take anyone for friends and protectors except God, His Messenger, and the believers? God is fully aware of all your actions."/>
		<aya index="17" text="It is not right that the polytheists should frequent God's places of worship while they are self-confessed unbelievers. It is they whose works shall come to nothing and they shall abide in Hell."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Only he should tend God's houses of worship who believes in God and the Last Day, and is constant in prayer, and spends in charity, and stands in awe of none but God: such people may hope to be among the rightly guided."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Do you regard giving water to pilgrims and tending the Sacred Mosque as being equal to the deeds of those who believe in God and the Last Day and who strive in God's path? They are not equal in the sight of God. God does not guide such unjust people."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Those who have believed and have migrated, and have striven for God's sake with their possessions and persons, stand much higher in God's esteem. It is they who will triumph;"/>

		<aya index="22" text="There they will dwell for ever. Truly there is an immense reward with God."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Believers, do not take your fathers and your brothers for allies if they choose denial of truth in preference to faith. Those among you who ally themselves with them are wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Say, &quot;If your fathers and your sons and your brothers and your spouses and your tribe, and the worldly goods which you have acquired, and the commerce which you fear will decline, and the homes you love are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and the struggle for His cause, then wait until God fulfills His decree. God does not guide the disobedient people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Indeed, God has helped you on many occasions. On the day of Hunayn, when you took pride in your great numbers, they proved of no avail to you -- for the earth, despite all its vastness, became [too] narrow for you and you turned back, in retreat."/>
		<aya index="26" text="God caused His tranquillity to descend upon His Messenger and the faithful: and sent down forces which you did not see: He punished those who denied the truth, for such is the recompense of all who deny the truth,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="then after that, God will turn in His mercy to whom He wills: God is forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Believers, know that the polytheists are impure, so they should not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year onwards. If you should fear destitution, God will enrich you out of His bounty, if He so wishes. God is aware and wise."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Fight those from among the People of the Book who believe neither in God, nor in the Last Day, nor hold as unlawful what God and His Messenger have declared to be unlawful, nor follow the true religion, until they pay the tax willingly and agree to submit."/>
		<aya index="30" text="The Jews say, &quot;Ezra is the son of God,&quot; and the Christians say, &quot;The Messiah is the son of God.&quot; These are but their baseless utterances. They imitate the assertions made in earlier times by those who deny the truth. May God destroy them! How far astray they have been led!"/>
		<aya index="31" text="They have taken their learned men and their monks for their lords besides God. So have they taken the Messiah, son of Mary, although they were commanded to worship only the One God. There is no deity but He. He is far above whatever they set up as His partners!"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They want to extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God seeks only to perfect His light, no matter how those who deny the truth may abhor it."/>
		<aya index="33" text="It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of Truth, so that He may make it prevail [ideologically] over every other religion, however much the polytheists may hate this."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Believers, many religious scholars and monks wrongfully appropriate people's possessions and turn people away from God's path! Tell those who hoard gold and silver instead of giving in God's cause that they will have a painful punishment:"/>
		<aya index="35" text="on the Day their treasure is heated up in the fire of hell, their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it, and they will be told, &quot;This is what you hoarded up for yourselves. Taste then what you were hoarding.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="On the Day God created heaven and earth, He decreed that the number of months should be twelve in number. Out of these, four are sacred. That is the true religion. Do not wrong your souls in these months. Fight the polytheists  all together, as they fight you all together, and know that God is with the righteous."/>
		<aya index="37" text="The postponing of [sacred months] is but one more instance of [their] refusal to acknowledge the truth -- by which those who are bent on denying the truth are led astray. They declare this to be permissible in one year and forbidden in another year, so that they may adjust the months which God has sanctified, thus making lawful what God has forbidden. Their evil deed seems fair to them: God does not guide those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="38" text="Believers, what is the matter with you that when you are asked to go forth in the cause of God, you cling slothfully to the land? Do you prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, compared to that of the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="39" text="If you do not go forth, He will punish you sternly and replace you by other people. You will not harm Him in the least. God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="40" text="If you do not support him [Muhammad], know that God did support him when those who denied the truth expelled him when the two of them were in the cave, he [Muhammad] told his companion, &quot;Do not worry; for God is with us.&quot; So God sent His tranquillity down on him and aided him with forces invisible to you and placed the word of those who disbelieved lowest, while God's word remained supreme. God is powerful and wise."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Go forth, whether lightly or heavily equipped, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, for the cause of God. That is better for you, if you only knew."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Had the gain been immediate and the journey shorter, they would have followed you: but the distance seemed too great for them. Yet they will swear by God, &quot;Had we been able, we would have gone out with you.&quot; They bring ruin upon themselves. God knows that they are surely lying."/>
		<aya index="43" text="May God pardon you! Why did you permit them to do so before it had become clear to you which ones were truthful, so that you might recognize the liars?"/>
		<aya index="44" text="Those who believe in God and the Last Day will never ask you to exempt them from striving with their wealth and their lives, God best knows the righteous,"/>
		<aya index="45" text="only those seek exemption who do not truly believe in God and the Last Day, and whose hearts have become a prey to doubt. Because they doubt, they waver."/>
		<aya index="46" text="If they had wished to go forth, they would surely have made some preparation for it, but God disliked their setting out [and being raised high in God's eyes] and held them back. They were told to stay behind with those who stay behind."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Had they gone forth with you, they would only have proved a source of evil for you, and would have run back and forth among you, seeking to sow discord among you: and among you there were some who would have willingly listened to them. God knows the evil-doers."/>
		<aya index="48" text="They have already tried to sow dissension, and hatched plots against you, until the truth became manifest and God's will prevailed, much to their disgust."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Some of them say, &quot;Give us leave to stay behind and do not put us to trial.&quot; Surely, they have already fallen into trial. Surely, Hell shall engulf those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="50" text="If good befalls you, it grieves them, but if a misfortune befalls you, they say, &quot;We took our precautions beforehand!&quot; They turn away rejoicing."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Say, &quot;Nothing can befall us, except what God has ordained for us. He is our Supreme Lord. In God let the faithful put their trust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Say, &quot;Are you waiting for anything to befall us except one of the two best things  [Victory in this world or Paradise in the next]? But we expect that God will send His punishment to you either directly from Himself, or by our hands. So wait, if you will; we too, are waiting with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Say, &quot;Whether you give willingly or unwillingly, your offerings shall not be accepted by God, for you are indeed a disobedient people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="The only reason their contributions are not accepted is that they have denied God and His Messenger, they come to the prayer half heartedly, and they offer contributions unwillingly."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Do not let their wealth and children impress you. For God seeks to punish them through these things in the life of this world, so that their souls shall depart while they are still denying the truth."/>
		<aya index="56" text="They swear by God that they are believers like you; but they are not. They are afraid [to appear in their true colours]:"/>
		<aya index="57" text="if they could find a place of refuge, or a cave or any hiding-place, they would run there with frantic haste."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Among them there are some who find fault with you concerning the distribution of alms. If a share is given to them, they are pleased, but if they receive nothing, they grow resentful."/>
		<aya index="59" text="If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger had given them and had said, &quot;God is sufficient for us. God will give us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To God alone do we turn with hope!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Alms are only for: the poor and the destitute, for those who collect zakat, for conciliating people's hearts, for freeing slaves, for those in debt, for spending for God's cause, and for travellers in need. It is a legal obligation enjoined by God. God is all-knowing and wise."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Among them are those who vex the Prophet by saying, &quot;He listens to everyone.&quot; Say, &quot;His listening to everyone is good for you; he believes in God and puts his trust in the faithful, and is a mercy to those of you who believe. Those who annoy God's Messenger shall have a painful punishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="They swear by God in order to please you [believers]: but it would be more fitting for them to please God and His Messenger, if they are believers."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Do they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger shall abide forever in the fire of Hell? That is the supreme humiliation."/>
		<aya index="64" text="The hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter [of the Quran] be sent down about them, telling them what is in their hearts -- say, &quot;Go on mocking. God will surely bring to light what you are dreading.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="If you ask them, they will say, &quot;We were only joking and playing with words.&quot; Say, &quot;Would you make a mockery of God and of His Revelations and of His Messenger?"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Make no excuses; you rejected the faith after you accepted it.&quot; If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for they are guilty."/>
		<aya index="67" text="The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike. They enjoin what is evil, forbid what is right and they are niggardly when it comes to spending for the cause of God. They have forgotten God, so He has forgotten them. The hypocrites are the disobedient ones."/>
		<aya index="68" text="God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and those who deny the truth, the Fire of Hell. They shall abide in it forever. That is a sufficient recompense for them. God has rejected them. They shall have everlasting punishment."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Like those before you who were stronger than you, possessed more wealth and children; they enjoyed their share in this life as you have enjoyed yours; like them, you have indulged in idle talk. It is they whose works shall come to nothing in this world and in the life to come -- and it is they who shall be the losers."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Have they never heard the stories about their predecessors, the peoples of Noah, 'Ad, Thamud, Abraham, Midian, and of the ruined cities? Their messengers brought them clear evidence of the truth. It was not God who wronged them; they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="71" text="The believers, both men and women, are friends to each other; they enjoin what is good and forbid evil, they attend to their prayers and pay the alms and obey God and His Messenger. On these God will have mercy, for God is almighty and wise."/>
		<aya index="72" text="God has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens through which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and fine dwelling places in Gardens of eternity. But the good pleasure of God is greater still. That is the supreme achievement."/>
		<aya index="73" text="O Prophet, strive against those who deny the truth and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode shall be Hell: an evil destination."/>
		<aya index="74" text="They swear by God that they did not, yet they uttered the words of denial of truth after they had accepted Islam. They meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out, and being spiteful was their only response to God, who had enriched them out of His bounty, and to His Messenger. If they repent, it will indeed be better for them. If they turn away, God will punish them with grievous suffering in this world and the Hereafter, and there will be no one on earth to protect or help them."/>
		<aya index="75" text="There are some among them who pledged themselves to God, saying, &quot;If God gives us something out of His bounty, we shall certainly give alms and be righteous,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="but when He bestowed His favours on them they grew niggardly, and turned away in aversion."/>
		<aya index="77" text="So He caused hypocrisy to settle in their hearts until the Day of their meeting with Him, because they broke their word to God, and because they lied."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Do they not know that God knows what they conceal and what they talk about in secret? That God knows all that is hidden?"/>
		<aya index="79" text="As for those who ridicule such believers as give alms freely for the sake of God and taunt those who find nothing to give save that which they earn through their toil, God will cause their ridicule to rebound on them: they shall have a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="80" text="It is the same whether or not you ask forgiveness for them. Even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them, for they have denied God and His Messenger. God does not guide the evil-doers."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Those who stayed at home were glad that they were left behind by God's Messenger. They hated the thought of striving for God's cause with their possessions and their persons. They said, &quot;Do not go forth  in this heat.&quot; Say, &quot;The Fire of Hell is far hotter.&quot; If only they could understand."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Let them laugh a little and weep much in return for their misdeeds."/>
		<aya index="83" text="So [Prophet], if God brings you back to a group of them, and should they ask your leave to go forth with you, say, &quot;You shall never go forth with me and shall never fight an enemy with me. You chose to sit at home the first time, so sit now with those who remain behind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="And never [O Muhammad] pray for one of them who dies, nor stand by his grave. For they denied God and His Messenger, and died rebellious."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Do not let their wealth and their children dazzle you. God only wants to punish them through these things in this world, and let their souls depart while they deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="86" text="When a chapter is revealed enjoining, &quot;Believe in God and strive for the cause of God along with His Messenger,&quot; the wealthy among them ask you to exempt them saying, &quot;Let us stay with those who are to stay behind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They preferred to be with [the women], who remained behind [at home]: their hearts are sealed and so they do not understand."/>
		<aya index="88" text="But the Messenger and those who shared his faith strove hard with their possessions and their lives. It is they who shall have all kinds of good, and it is they who shall surely prosper."/>
		<aya index="89" text="God has prepared for them Gardens through which rivers flow, in which they shall abide forever. That is the supreme triumph."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Some of the desert Arabs, too, came to make excuses, asking to be granted exemption. Those who lied to God and His Messenger stayed behind at home. Those who denied the truth among them will be afflicted with a painful chastisement,"/>
		<aya index="91" text="but no blame shall attach to the weak, the sick, and those who have no means to spend, provided they are sincere to God and His Messenger. There is no reason to reproach those who do good deeds; God is most forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Nor [does any blame] attach to those who came to you to be provided with mounts, and when you said, &quot;I can find no mounts for you,&quot; they went back, and tears welled up in their eyes with sadness, since they could not find any way to contribute."/>
		<aya index="93" text="The blameworthy are those who are men of wealth and yet ask for exemption. They are content to be with those [women] who stay behind. God has sealed their hearts: they do not understand."/>
		<aya index="94" text="They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, &quot;Do not make excuses, we will not believe you. God has already informed us about you. God will see your actions, as will His Messenger. Then you will be returned to the One who knows the seen and the unseen and He will tell you all that you used to do.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="When you return, they will swear to you by God so that you may leave them alone, so leave them alone. They are unclean, and Hell will be their home as a reward for their actions --"/>
		<aya index="96" text="they will swear to you, so that you may be pleased with them. But [even] if you are pleased with them, God is not pleased with rebellious people."/>
		<aya index="97" text="The desert Arabs are more stubborn in their denial of truth and hypocrisy, and are the least likely to be aware of the limits which God has revealed to His Messenger. God is all knowing and wise."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Some desert Arabs regard what they give for the cause of God as a fine and wait for some misfortune to befall you. May ill-fortune befall them! God hears all and knows all."/>
		<aya index="99" text="There are also those among them who believe in God and the Last Day and regard what they spend for the cause of God as a means of bringing them nearer to God and of deserving the prayers of the Messenger. This shall certainly be for them a means of drawing near to God. God will admit them into His mercy; God is indeed most forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="100" text="As for those who led the way, the first of the emigrants and the supporters, as well as those who nobly followed them, God is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him; He has prepared for them Gardens through which rivers flow, where they shall dwell forever. That is the supreme achievement."/>
		<aya index="101" text="Some of the desert Arabs around you are hypocrites as are some of the people of Madinah -- they are obdurate in their hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We know them. We shall cause them to suffer doubly and then they will be subjected to a great punishment."/>
		<aya index="102" text="There are others who have confessed their wrongdoing, who have done some good deeds and some bad ones. It is likely that God will turn to them in mercy. Surely, God is most forgiving, merciful."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Take alms out of their wealth to cleanse them and purify them, and pray for them; your prayer will be a comfort to them. God is all hearing, all knowing."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Do they not know that God accepts the repentance of His servants and receives their alms, and that God is the Forgiving, the Merciful One?"/>
		<aya index="105" text="Say, &quot;Do as you will. God will watch your conduct and so will His Messenger and the believers. Soon you will be brought back to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest: then He will show you the truth of all that you have done.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="106" text="[There are yet] others whose cases are deferred until it is God's will to judge them. He will either punish them, or turn in mercy to them; God is all knowing and wise."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Then there are those who built a mosque to cause harm, to spread apostasy and disunity among the believers -- as an outpost for those who from the outset warred on God and His Messenger.

		<aya index="31" text="I do not say to you that I possess God's treasures, or that I have knowledge of the unseen, or that I am an angel. Nor do I say concerning those upon whom you look with contempt, that God will not bestow any good upon them -- God knows best what is in their hearts. If I did, I would certainly be one of the wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="&quot;Noah,&quot; they replied, &quot;you have argued with us, and argued to excess. Now bring down upon us what you threaten us with, if you speak the truth!?&quot;"/>

		<aya index="44" text="A voice cried out, &quot;Earth, swallow up your waters. O sky, cease your rain.&quot; The waters receded. The command was fulfilled. The Ark came to rest on Mount Judi. It was said, &quot;Away with the wrong-doing people.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="47" text="Joseph said, &quot;You shall sow for seven consecutive years as usual, but leave in the ear the harvest that you reap, except for a little which you may eat."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Then there will follow seven years of great hardship which will consume all but a little of what you stored."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Then a year will come after that when people will have abundant rain and when once more they will press [wine and oil].&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="The king said, &quot;Bring him to me.&quot; When the king's messenger came to Joseph, he said, &quot;Go back to your master and ask him about the women who cut their hands: my Lord knows well their guile.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="51" text="The king asked the women, &quot;What was the truth of the affair in which you tried to seduce Joseph?&quot; The women said, &quot;God forbid! We know no evil of him.&quot; The wife of the nobleman said, &quot;The truth has now come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him; he is surely an honest man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="&quot;From this,&quot; said Joseph, &quot;[The nobleman] should know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that God does not guide the plotting of the treacherous."/>
		<aya index="53" text="I am not trying to absolve myself: for man's very soul incites him to evil unless my Lord bestows His mercy. Indeed, my Lord is forgiving and merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="The king said, &quot;Bring him to me. I will take him for my special service.&quot; And when he had spoken to him, he said, &quot;From now on you will dwell with us, honoured and trusted.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="55" text="Joseph said, &quot;Place in my charge the storehouses of the land; for I am a good and knowledgeable custodian.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="Thus We caused Joseph to be established in a position of authority in the land. He could dwell therein wherever he pleased. We bestow Our mercy on whomever We please, and We do not allow the reward of the righteous to go to waste."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Yet the reward of the hereafter is best for those who believe and are mindful of God."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Joseph's brothers arrived and presented themselves before him. He recognized them, but they did not know him."/>
		<aya index="59" text="When he had made provision for them, he told them, &quot;Bring me your brother on your father's side. Do you not see that I give you full measure and that I am the best of hosts?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="But if you do not bring him to me, you shall have no grain from me, nor shall you ever approach me again.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="They replied, &quot;We shall try to persuade his father to send him with us. We shall do [our utmost]!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="Joseph said to his servants, &quot;Put their money back into their saddlebags, so that they will recognize it when they return home to their family; thus they may come back.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="When they returned to their father, they said, &quot;Our father, any [further] measure of grain has been denied us, so send our brother [Benjamin] along with us, so that we may obtain our measure [of grain]; and, we shall guard him well.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="He replied, &quot;Am I to trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother? But God is the best of guardians, the Most Merciful of all.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="When they opened their packs, they discovered that their money had been returned to them. They said, &quot;Our father, what more do we desire than this? This money of ours has been returned to us, so we shall [again] buy food for our family and we shall guard our brother, and we shall obtain an additional camel-load of grain. This [that we bring now] is a small quantity.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="He [Jacob] said, &quot;I will never send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge, before God, that you will indeed bring him back to me, unless you yourselves are trapped [in a compulsive situation].&quot; And when they had given him their solemn pledge, [Jacob] said, &quot;God shall be witness to all that we say.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="&quot;O my sons! Do not all of you enter [the city] by one gate; enter by separate gates. I cannot help you in any way against God; judgement is His alone. In Him I have put my trust. In Him let the faithful put their trust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They entered [safely] as their father had told them. However, he had no power to guard them against God's decree. It was only a wish in Jacob's soul which he had thus fulfilled. He was possessed of knowledge which We had given him. But most people have no knowledge."/>
		<aya index="69" text="When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother [Benjamin] aside. He said, &quot;I am your brother, so do not feel distressed about whatever they have been doing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="And when he had given them their provisions, he placed a drinking-cup in his brother's pack. Then a crier called out after them, &quot;Men of the caravan! You have committed theft!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="They said, turning towards him, &quot;What is it that you have lost?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="&quot;We miss the royal measuring bowl,&quot; he replied. &quot;He who brings it shall have a camel-load of corn. I pledge my word for it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said, &quot;By God, you [ought to] know we have not come here to cause any trouble in the land. We are not thieves!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="The Egyptians asked them, &quot;And if we find that you are lying, what penalty shall we mete out to you?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="They replied, &quot;The penalty should be that he in whose saddlebag it is found, should be held [as bondman] to atone for the crime. That is how we punish the wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="He [the herald] searched their bags before his brother's and then took out the cup from his brother's bag. In this way, We devised a plan on behalf of Joseph. He could not have detained his brother under the King's law, unless God so willed. We exalt whoever We please: but above those who have knowledge there is One all knowing."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They said, &quot;If he is a thief, a brother of his had [also] committed theft before him.&quot; But Joseph kept his secret and revealed nothing to them. He said [to himself], &quot;Your deed was worse. God best knows the things you speak of.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said, &quot;O exalted one, he has a very aged father, take one of us in his place. We can see that you are a very good man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="He replied, &quot;God forbid that we should take anyone other than the person on whom we found our property. In that case, we would clearly be wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="When they had lost all hope of [persuading] him, they withdrew, conferring among themselves. The eldest said, &quot;Do you not know that your father took from you a pledge in God's name. You have already failed with regard to Joseph, so I shall never leave the land until my father permits me to, or God decides [things] for me. He is the best judge!"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Return to your father and say, 'Father, your son has committed a theft. We testify only to what we know. How could we guard against the unforeseen?"/>
		<aya index="82" text="Inquire of [the people of] the city where we lodged, and of the caravan with which we travelled. We are telling you the truth.'&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="Jacob said, &quot;No, but you have yourselves contrived a story. But it is best to be patient. God may well bring them all back to me [in the end]. For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="And he turned away from them, crying, &quot;Alas for Joseph!&quot; His eyes went white with grief, and he was filled with sorrow."/>
		<aya index="85" text="They said, &quot;By God, will you keep on remembering Joseph until your health is ruined, and you die?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="He said &quot;I only complain of my anguish and my sorrow to God. God has made known to me things that you do not know."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Go, my sons, and seek news of Joseph and his brother. Do not despair of God's mercy; none but those who deny the truth despair of God's mercy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="When his brothers presented themselves before Joseph, they pleaded, &quot;Exalted one, distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought only a paltry sum; but give us full measure. Be charitable to us. Truly, God rewards the charitable.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He said, &quot;Are you aware of what you did to Joseph and his brother in ignorance?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They exclaimed, &quot;Are you indeed Joseph?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am Joseph and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious to us. The truth is that God does not waste the reward of those who do good, who are righteous and steadfast.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="[The brothers] said, &quot;By God! Most certainly God has raised you high above us, and we have indeed been guilty!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said, &quot;No blame [shall fall] on you this day; may God forgive you! And He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Go with this shirt of mine and cast it upon my father's face. He will recover his sight; thereupon come [back] to me with all your family.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="When the caravan set out from Egypt, their father [in Canaan] said, &quot;You may think I am senile, but I certainly perceive the breath of Joseph.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="They said, &quot;By God, you still persist in your illusions!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="But when the bearer of the good news arrived and cast the shirt on Jacob's face, his eyesight returned and he said, &quot;Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="They said, &quot;O our father! Ask forgiveness for our sins -- we were truly in the wrong.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said, &quot;I shall certainly ask my Lord to forgive you. Surely, He is the Most Forgiving and Merciful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Then, when they presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his parents to him and said, &quot;Welcome to Egypt, in safety, if God wills!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="100" text="He helped his parents to a couch and they all fell down on their knees before him. He said, &quot;My father, this is the interpretation of my dream. My Lord has made it come true! He was kind to me when He let me out of prison and brought you from the desert after Satan had brought about discord between me and my brethren. My Lord is the best planner in achieving what He will; He is All Knowing, and Truly Wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Then Joseph prayed, &quot;My Lord, You have given me power and taught me the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my patron in this world and the Hereafter! Make me die in submission to You and admit me among the righteous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="102" text="These are tidings of the unseen that We reveal to you, [O Prophet], though you were not present with them when they plotted and agreed upon a plan."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Yet most men will not become believers, no matter how eager you may be."/>
		<aya index="104" text="You shall not ask them for any reward for this. It is but a reminder for all mankind."/>

		<aya index="108" text="Say, &quot;This is my way; on the basis of sure knowledge, I call on you to have faith in God, I and those who follow me. God is Holy; I am not one of those who associate partners with God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="109" text="All the messengers We sent before you [Muhammad] were human beings to whom We made revelations; they were men chosen from the people of their towns.

		<aya index="110" text="When the messengers lost all hopes and thought that they had been told lies, Our help came to them: We saved whoever We pleased, but Our punishment will not be averted from the guilty."/>
		<aya index="111" text="In their stories there is a lesson for men of understanding. This [Quran] is no invented tale, but a confirmation of the previous [scripture] and a detailed explanation of all things as well as guidance and mercy to true believers."/>

		<aya index="1" text="Alif Lam Mim Ra. These are the verses of the Book. What is sent down to you from your Lord is the truth, yet most men do not believe in it."/>
		<aya index="2" text="It was God who raised the heavens with no visible supports, and then established Himself on the throne; He has regulated the sun and the moon, so that each will pursue its course for an appointed time; He ordains all things and makes plain His revelations, so that you may be certain of meeting your Lord;"/>
		<aya index="3" text="it was He who spread out the earth and placed upon it mountains and rivers, and fruits of every kind in male and female pairs. He drew the veil of night over the day. In all this, truly, there are signs for people who reflect."/>
		<aya index="4" text="On the earth are diverse tracts, adjoining one another: vineyards and cornfields and groves of palm, the single and the clustered. Their fruits are nourished by the same water; yet We make the taste of some excel that of others. In this also are signs for people who understand."/>
		<aya index="5" text="If anything can astonish you, you should surely be astonished at their asking, &quot;What? When we become dust, shall we be created anew?&quot; These are the ones who deny their Lord: around their necks there shall be fetters. They are the inheritors of the Fire, and shall abide therein forever."/>
		<aya index="6" text="They demand that you hasten on the evil rather than the good, although there have been many examples of punishment before them -- your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind, despite their wrongdoings, but He is truly severe in punishment."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Those who deny the truth ask, &quot;Why has no sign been sent down to him by His Lord?&quot; But you are only a warner; every people has its guide."/>
		<aya index="8" text="God knows what every female bears. He knows of every change within the womb. For everything He has a proper measure;"/>

		<aya index="11" text="Each has guardian angels before him and behind him, who watch him at God's command. God does not change the condition of a people's lot, unless they change what is in their hearts. But when God decrees punishment for a people, none can ward it off. Besides Him, they have no protector."/>

		<aya index="13" text="and the thunder glorifies Him with His praise and the angels do so too in awe of Him, and He sends His thunderbolts to strike anyone He pleases, yet they dispute about God, who is inexorable in His power."/>
		<aya index="14" text="The only true appeal is to God alone; those they appeal to instead of Him will never respond to them in any way. They are like a man who stretches forth his hands toward the water, so that it may reach his mouth, but it never does. The calls of those who deny the truth are all in vain."/>

Is darkness equal to the light? Or have they assigned partners to God who create as He creates, so that both creations appear to them alike?&quot;  Say, &quot;God is the Creator of all things. He is the One, the Almighty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="17" text="He sends down water from the sky that fills riverbeds to overflowing, each according to its measure. The torrent carries along swelling foam, akin to what rises from smelted ore from which man makes ornaments and tools. God thus depicts truth and falsehood. The scum is cast away, but whatever is of use to man remains behind. God thus speaks in parables."/>

		<aya index="31" text="Even if there were a Quran by which mountains could be set in motion, by which the earth could be rent asunder, or by which the dead could be made to speak [they would not believe in it]. Surely all things are subject to God's will. Are the faithful unaware that, had He pleased, God could have guided all mankind? Calamity shall not cease to strike those who deny the truth because of their misdeeds or to strike near their homes, until God's promise be fulfilled. God will not fail to keep His promise."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Other messengers were also mocked before you; but though I granted respite to those who denied the truth, at last I seized them, and how awful was My punishment."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Is then He who watches over every soul and its actions [like any other]? Yet they ascribe partners to God. Say, &quot;Name them! Or do you presume to inform Him of something on the earth of which He does not know?

		<aya index="20" text="for if they find you out, they will stone you to death, or force you back into their faith. In that case you would never prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="Thus We disclosed things to them so that they might know that God's promise was true and there was no doubt about the Hour [Judgement Day]. The people argued about them among themselves. They said, &quot;Build a monument over them. Their Lord knows best concerning them.&quot; Those who prevailed in their affair said, &quot;Let us surely build a place of worship over them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Some will say, &quot;They were three, the fourth was their dog,&quot; and others will say, &quot;They were five, the sixth was their dog,&quot; guessing at random. And yet others say, &quot;They were seven, the eighth was their dog.&quot; Say, &quot;My Lord knows best their number.&quot; Only a few know anything about them. Therefore, do not enter into controversies over them, nor seek information about them from any of them;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="never say of anything, &quot;I shall certainly do this tomorrow,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="without [adding], &quot;if God so wills.&quot; Remember your Lord whenever you might forget and say, &quot;I trust my Lord will guide me to that which is even nearer to the right path than this.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="[Some say], &quot;They stayed in their cave three hundred years,&quot; and to that some have added another nine years."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Say, &quot;God knows best how long they stayed in it.&quot; Only God has knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and on the earth. How well He sees and how well He hears! Man has no other guardian besides Him. He allows none to share His sovereignty."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Proclaim what has been revealed to you from your Lord's Book. None can change His words. You shall find no refuge besides Him."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Keep yourself attached to those who call on their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His pleasure; and do not let your eyes turn away from them, desiring the attraction of worldly life; and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, one who pursues his own whims and becomes dissolute."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Say, &quot;This is the truth from your Lord. Let him who will, believe in it, and him who will, deny it.&quot; For the wrongdoers We have prepared a Fire which will cover them like a canopy, and if they beg for water, they will be given water as hot as molten lead, which will scald their faces: how dreadful a drink, and how evil a resting place!"/>
		<aya index="30" text="As for those who believe and do good deeds, We do not let the reward of anyone who does a good deed go to waste,"/>
		<aya index="31" text="they shall dwell in the Gardens of eternity where rivers flow at their feet. Reclining upon raised couches, they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and will wear green robes of fine silk and heavy brocade. An excellent reward and an excellent resting place!"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Recite to them the parable of two men! One of them We provided with two vineyards which We surrounded with date-palms, and placed a field of grain in between;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="each garden produced its fruit and did not fail to yield its best; We even caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="and so he had fruit in abundance. While conversing with his companion, he said, &quot;I am wealthier than you are, and have a bigger following!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Having thus harmed his own soul, he entered his garden saying, &quot;I do not think this will ever perish,"/>
		<aya index="36" text="and I do not believe that the Hour will ever come. Even if I am returned to my Lord, I shall surely find a better place than this.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="His companion replied, in the course of their discussion, &quot;Do you deny Him who created you from dust, from a small drop of fluid, then formed you into a man?"/>
		<aya index="38" text="But as far as I am concerned, God alone is my Lord and I set up no partners with Him."/>
		<aya index="39" text="When you entered your garden, why did you not say, &quot;That which God wills [will surely come to pass], there is no power save with God?&quot; Although you see I have less wealth and offspring than you,"/>
		<aya index="40" text="my Lord may well give me a garden better than yours and send down thunderbolts from heaven upon your vineyard, turning it into a barren waste;"/>
		<aya index="41" text="or its water may sink into the earth, so that you will never be able to find it again!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="So it was, and all his fruit was destroyed. The vines had all fallen down on their trellises, and their owner wrung his hands, bewailing all that he had spent on his garden. He said, &quot;Would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="He had no party to help him against God, nor was he able to defend himself."/>
		<aya index="44" text="The only support is from God, the True God. He is the best in rewarding and the best in respect of the final outcome."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Give them an example about worldly life. It is like the vegetation of the earth that thrives when watered by the rain, which We send down from the sky, and then it all becomes stubble which the wind blows away. God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world. But deeds of lasting merit are better rewarded by your Lord and a far better source of hope."/>
		<aya index="47" text="The Day We shall make the mountains move and you will see the earth laid bare, and We shall gather all mankind together and shall not leave any one of them behind."/>
		<aya index="48" text="They will be ranged before your Lord, standing in rows and He will say to them, &quot;Now you have come to Us as We created you at first. But you supposed that We would not appoint the time for the fulfillment of Our promise to you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="The Book [of deeds] will be placed before them and you will see the guilty apprehensive about its contents. They will say, &quot;Woe to us! What a record this is! It does not leave any deed, small or large, unaccounted for!&quot; They will find everything they ever did laid in front of them: your Lord will not be unjust to anyone."/>
		<aya index="50" text="When We said to the angels, &quot;Prostrate yourselves before Adam,&quot; all prostrated themselves except Satan. He was one of the jinn and he disobeyed his Lord's command. Do you then take him and his offspring as protectors instead of Me, despite their enmity towards you? This is an evil exchange for the wrongdoers!"/>
		<aya index="51" text="I did not call them to witness at the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor at their own creation; I do not take as My helpers those who lead others astray."/>
		<aya index="52" text="On that Day He will say to them, &quot;Call on those whom you thought to be My partners.&quot; And they will call on them, but their prayer will not be heard; and We shall place a barrier [of enmity] between them."/>
		<aya index="53" text="The guilty shall see the Fire and realize that they are going to fall into it: they shall find no way of escape from it."/>
		<aya index="54" text="We have explained in various ways in this Quran, for the benefit of mankind, all kinds of examples, but man is most contentious."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Nothing prevents people from believing when they are given guidance or from asking forgiveness of their Lord, but the fact that the fate of the previous peoples should befall them or to have the punishment come upon them face to face."/>
		<aya index="56" text="We only send the messengers to bring good news and to give warning. Those who deny use fallacious arguments to nullify the truth, treating My revelations and My warnings as a jest."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Who is more wicked than he who has been reminded of the revelations of his Lord, then turns away from them and forgets what his own hands have done? We have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand Our words, and made them hard of hearing. Call them as you may to the right path, they shall never be guided."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Your Lord is the Forgiving One, the possessor of mercy. If He had to take them to task for the wrongs they have done, He would have hastened their punishment. They have an appointed time beyond which there will be no escape for them."/>
		<aya index="59" text="We destroyed these communities when they went on doing wrong, and We appointed a time for their destruction."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Recall how Moses said to his servant, &quot;I shall not give up until I reach the place where both seas meet, even if it takes me years!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="But when at last they came to the land where the two seas met, they forgot their fish and it swiftly made its way into the sea."/>
		<aya index="62" text="After they had passed the place, Moses said to his young companion, &quot;Bring us our morning meal; we have indeed been fatigued by this journey.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He replied, &quot;Did you see when we were resting by the rock, that I forgot the fish? Satan made me forget it, so I did not mention it. It made its way to the sea in a miraculous way!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Moses said, &quot;That is just what we were looking for.&quot; So they went back the way they had come,"/>
		<aya index="65" text="and they found one of Our servants to whom We had granted Our mercy and had given a knowledge from Ourself."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said to him, &quot;May I follow you, so that you may guide me by what you have been taught?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He replied, &quot;You will not be able to bear with me patiently."/>
		<aya index="68" text="How could you be patient in matters beyond your knowledge?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Moses said, &quot;God willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in any thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="He said, &quot;Well then, if you would follow me, do not ask me about anything till I speak of it to you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="So they set out, but, when they got into a boat, the man made a hole in it. Moses exclaimed, &quot;Have you made a hole in the boat to drown the people in it? You have indeed done a dreadful thing!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="He replied, &quot;Did I not tell you that you would never be able to bear with me patiently?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="He said, &quot;Do not take me to task for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard on me on account of what I have done!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="So they travelled on. Then they met a young boy and the man killed him. Moses said, &quot;Have you slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone? Indeed, you have done a terrible thing!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="The man said, &quot;Did I not tell you that you would not be able to have any patience with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Moses replied, &quot;If I ever ask you about anything after this, do not let me accompany you. I will have given you sufficient excuse.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="So they went on until they came to a town. They asked its people for food, but were refused hospitality. They found a wall in the town which was about to fall down. His companion buttressed it and Moses said, &quot;Had you wished, you could have demanded payment for your labours.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="He answered, &quot;This is where you and I must part company. But first I will tell you the meaning of the things you could not bear with patiently."/>
		<aya index="79" text="&quot;The boat belonged to some poor people who made their living from the sea. I wanted to damage it because there was a king coming behind them who was seizing every boat by force."/>
		<aya index="80" text="As for the youth, his parents were believers and we feared that he would trouble them by rebellion and denial of truth."/>
		<aya index="81" text="We wanted their Lord to replace him with someone purer than him and more compassionate."/>
		<aya index="82" text="&quot;The wall belonged to two young orphans in the town whose father had been a righteous man, and a treasure of theirs lay underneath it. So your Lord wanted them to come of age and then to dig up their treasure as a mercy from Him. I did not do [it] of my own accord. That is the explanation of the things about which you were not able to restrain yourself.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="They will ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnayn. Say, &quot;I will give you an account of him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="We established him in the land, and gave him the means to achieve all things."/>
		<aya index="85" text="He travelled on a certain road;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of murky water and near it he found some people. We said, &quot;Dhu'l-Qarnayn! You can either punish them or else you can treat them with gentleness.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="He said, &quot;We shall certainly punish him who does wrong; then he shall be brought back to his Lord who will punish him with a grievous punishment,"/>
		<aya index="88" text="but whoever believes and does good works shall have a good reward and We shall facilitate his matter by Our command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="Then he followed yet another path,"/>
		<aya index="90" text="until he came to the rising-place of the sun, where he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Thus indeed it was. We had full knowledge of him."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Then he followed still another path,"/>
		<aya index="93" text="until he came between two mountains. He found beside them a people who could scarcely understand a word [of his language]."/>
		<aya index="94" text="They said, &quot;O Dhu'l-Qarnayn! Gog and Magog are causing corruption in the land, so may we pay you tribute on condition that you set a barrier between us and them?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="He said, &quot;What My Lord has given me is better [than any tribute]. Help me with a force of labourers and I will erect a barrier between you and them:"/>
		<aya index="96" text="bring me blocks of iron.&quot; Then, when he had filled the gap between the mountain sides [he said], &quot;Now blow on the fire with your bellows.&quot; When the iron blocks were red with heat, he said, &quot;Bring me molten brass to pour on them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="So they [Gog and Magog] were not able to scale it, nor were they able to bore through it,"/>
		<aya index="98" text="and he said, &quot;This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to dust. My Lord's promise is ever true!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="On that Day, We shall let them surge against each other like waves and then the Trumpet will be blown and We shall gather them all together."/>
		<aya index="100" text="On that Day We shall lay Hell bare before those who deny the truth,"/>
		<aya index="101" text="who have turned a blind eye to My reminder and a deaf ear to My warning."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Do those who deny the truth, think that they can make My servants patrons instead of Me? We have reserved Hell as a lodging for those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Say, &quot;Shall I tell you of those who will lose the most through their actions?"/>
		<aya index="104" text="They are those whose efforts have been wasted in the life of the world while they thought they were doing good."/>
		<aya index="105" text="They are those who deny their Lord's signs and the meeting with Him.&quot; So their works are in vain, and We shall give them no weight on the Day of Resurrection."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Hell will be their reward, because they denied the truth, and made a jest of My signs and My messengers."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Those who believe and do good works shall have the gardens of Paradise for their abode."/>
		<aya index="108" text="They shall forever dwell in the Gardens of Paradise, desiring no change."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Tell them, &quot;If the ocean became ink for writing the words of my Lord, surely the ocean would be exhausted before the words of my Lord came to an end -- even if We were to add another ocean to it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="110" text="Say, &quot;I am only a human being like yourselves. It is revealed to me that your God is One God. So let him who hopes to meet his Lord do good deeds and let him associate no one else in the worship of his Lord.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="7" text="&quot;Zachariah, We bring you good news of a son whose name shall be John. We have not given such a name to anyone before.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="&quot;My Lord!&quot; [said Zachariah],  &quot;How shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached such extreme old age?&quot;"/>

		<aya index="11" text="Then Zachariah came forth from the shrine to his people and told them by signs to glorify the Lord morning and evening."/>
		<aya index="12" text="To John We said, &quot;Hold fast the Book,&quot; and while he was still a child, We bestowed upon him wisdom,"/>
		<aya index="13" text="and tenderness [of heart] and purity. He was pious,"/>

		<aya index="15" text="Peace be on him on the day of his birth, and on the day of his death, and peace will be on him on the day he is raised up to life again."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Recount in the Book how Mary withdrew from her people to an eastern place"/>
		<aya index="17" text="and kept herself in seclusion from them. We sent her Our angel, who presented himself to her as a full-grown human being."/>
		<aya index="18" text="When she saw him, she said, &quot;I seek refuge in the compassionate God from you; [do not come near] if you fear the Lord.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="&quot;I am only the messenger of your Lord,&quot; he replied. &quot;I shall bestow upon you the gift of a son endowed with purity.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="26" text="Eat and drink and rejoice. And if you see any human being say, 'I have vowed a fast [of silence] to the Gracious God, and will not speak with any human being today.'&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Carrying her child, she brought him to her people. They said, &quot;O Mary, you have indeed done something terrible!"/>
		<aya index="28" text="Sister of Aaron, your father was not an evil man, nor was your mother an unchaste woman!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="She pointed to the child. They said, &quot;How shall we talk to someone who is a child in the cradle?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="[But] he said, &quot;I am God's servant. He has given me the Book and made me a prophet;"/>

		<aya index="36" text="God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him alone. That is the right path."/>

		<aya index="49" text="So when he had separated himself from them and from what they worshipped besides God, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We made each of them a prophet."/>
		<aya index="50" text="We granted them Our mercy and bestowed on them true and high renown."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Tell also of Moses in the Book. He was indeed a chosen one, and was a messenger and a prophet."/>
		<aya index="52" text="We called out to him from the right side of the mount and made him draw near to be in close communion with Us;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="and We gave him as his helper, out of Our mercy, his brother Aaron, having made him a prophet."/>

		<aya index="58" text="These are the ones whom God has favoured: the prophets from among the descendants of Adam and of those whom We carried in the Ark with Noah; the descendants of Abraham, of Israel, and of those whom We have guided and chosen.

		<aya index="59" text="But then they were succeeded by generations who neglected their prayers and were driven by their own desires. They will assuredly meet with destruction,"/>

		<aya index="61" text="Theirs shall be the Gardens of Eden, which the All Merciful has promised to His servants without their having seen them, and most surely His promise shall be fulfilled."/>

		<aya index="65" text="He is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between the two. So worship Him alone and be steadfast in His worship. Do you know of anyone equal to Him in His attributes?"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Man asks, &quot;When I am once dead, shall I be raised to life?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="But does man not remember that We created him when he was nothing before?"/>
		<aya index="68" text="By your Lord, We shall most surely gather them and the devils too; and bring them close to hell on their knees."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Then We shall carry off from every group those who were most stubborn in their opposition to the Gracious One,"/>

		<aya index="87" text="They answered, &quot;We did not break our promise to you of our own accord, but we had to carry loads of the people's ornaments and so we threw them [into the fire] for that was what the Samiri suggested,&quot;"/>

If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, remember that We first created you from dust, then from a sperm drop, then from clotted blood, then a lump of flesh, both shaped and unshaped, so that We might manifest to you [Our power]. We cause what We will to stay in the womb for an appointed time, then We bring you forth as infants and then We cause you to grow and reach full growth. Then, some of you will pass away early in life, while some of you will reach extreme old age in which they will know nothing of what they once knew. You see the earth, dead and barren, but no sooner do We send down rain upon it than it begins to stir and swell, and produce every kind of luxuriant vegetation:"/>

		<aya index="11" text="There are some who worship God half-heartedly, then, if some good befalls them, they are content with it, but if an ordeal befalls them, they revert to their former ways. They lose in this world as well in the Hereafter. That is a clear loss."/>
		<aya index="12" text="He calls on, instead of God, something that can neither harm him, nor benefit him. That is indeed straying far away --"/>
		<aya index="13" text="he calls on that which would sooner harm than help. Such a patron is indeed evil and such a companion is indeed evil."/>

		<aya index="15" text="Anyone who thinks that God will not help him [His messenger] in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch a rope up to the sky; then let him cut it off and see if his plan can help to remove the cause of his anger."/>

		<aya index="17" text="God will judge between the believers, the Jews, the Sabaeans, the Christians, the Magians and the polytheists on the Day of Judgement. Surely God is witness to everything."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Do you not see that whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, as well as the sun and the moon, and the stars and the mountains, and the trees and the beasts and many human beings -- all submit to God? But there are many who have become deserving of punishment. Whoever God disgraces, will have no one to honour him. Surely, God does what He wills."/>

		<aya index="26" text="We assigned to Abraham the site of the House, saying, &quot;Do not associate with Me anything and purify My House for those who circumambulate [the Kabah] and those who stand upright, and those who bow and prostrate themselves.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="30" text="Such is God's commandment. Whoever honours that which is declared sacred by God may be sure that it counts for good in the sight of his Lord. Livestock is lawful for you, except that which has already been explicitly forbidden. Then shun the abomination of the deities and shun all falsehood."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Devote yourselves to God, not associating any partners with Him. Whoever associates anything with God is like one who falls from heaven and is snatched by the birds or carried away by the wind to a distant place."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Thus it is. He who honours the symbols set up by God shows the piety of his heart."/>
		<aya index="33" text="You may benefit from the animals for an appointed time. Then they must be sacrificed at the Ancient House."/>
		<aya index="34" text="For every people We have appointed rites of sacrifice, so that they may pronounce the name of God over the cattle which He has provided for them. Your God is One God; surrender yourselves to Him; and give good news to the humble"/>
		<aya index="35" text="whose hearts are filled with awe at the mention of God; who endure adversity with fortitude, say their prayers regularly and spend out of what We have given them."/>
		<aya index="36" text="We have appointed for you the sacrificial camels as one of the symbols set up by God, in which there is much good for you. So invoke God's name over them as you line them up for slaughter, and when they have fallen down dead, feed yourselves and feed the needy -- those who do not ask as well as those who do. We have thus subjected them to you so that you may be grateful."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Their flesh and blood do not reach God: it is your piety that reaches Him. Thus God has subjected them to you, so that you may glorify Him for the guidance He has given you. Give glad tidings to those who do good."/>
		<aya index="38" text="God will surely defend the believers. God does not love the perfidious and the ungrateful."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Permission to fight is granted to those who are attacked, because they have been wronged, God indeed has the power to help them,"/>
		<aya index="40" text="they are those who have been driven out of their homes unjustly, only because they said, &quot;Our Lord is God.&quot; If God did not repel the aggression of some people by means of others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of God is much invoked, would surely be destroyed. God will surely help him who helps His cause -- God is indeed powerful and mighty."/>
		<aya index="41" text="[They are] those who, if We established them in the land, would say their prayers regularly and pay the zakat and enjoin good and forbid evil. The final outcome of all affairs rests with God."/>
		<aya index="42" text="If your opponents deny you, remember that, before them, the people of Noah and the tribes of 'Ad and Thamud denied their messengers likewise."/>
		<aya index="43" text="So did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot,"/>
		<aya index="44" text="and the inhabitants of Midian also charged their prophets with falsehood. Moses was also rejected. I gave respite to those who denied the truth, but then I seized them. Consider then, how terrible My repudiation of them was."/>
		<aya index="45" text="How many a town We destroyed which was given to wrongdoing, so that its roofs fell down, and how many a well is deserted and how many a lofty castle is in ruins."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Have these people not travelled through the land to make their hearts understand and let their ears hear; the truth is that it is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts that are in the bosoms that are blinded."/>
		<aya index="47" text="They ask you to hasten the punishment; God will never go back on His promise. A Day with your Lord is like a thousand years in your reckoning."/>
		<aya index="48" text="To how many a town We gave respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I seized it. To Me all things shall return."/>

		<aya index="50" text="Those who believe and do good deeds shall be forgiven and shall receive an honourable provision."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Whereas those who strive against Our signs, seeking to defeat their purpose, shall be the inmates of the Fire."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Whenever We sent any messenger or prophet before you, and he recited anything [of Our revelation], Satan tampered with it. But God abrogates Satan's interjections and then He firmly reaffirms His revelations. God is all knowing and all wise."/>
		<aya index="53" text="He makes Satan's suggestions a trial for those whose hearts are diseased or hardened, and, surely, the wrongdoers are far gone in error,"/>
		<aya index="54" text="so that those who are given knowledge may realize that this is the truth from your Lord and thus believe in it, and so that in their hearts they may humbly submit to Him. God will surely guide the faithful to a straight path."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Those who deny the truth will continue in doubt until the [Last] Hour suddenly comes upon them or the scourge of the woeful Day descends upon them."/>
		<aya index="56" text="On that Day all control will belong to God. He will judge between them. Those who believe and do good deeds shall enter the Gardens of Bliss,"/>
		<aya index="57" text="but those who deny the truth and deny Our signs will receive a humiliating punishment."/>
		<aya index="58" text="As for those who left their homes for the cause of God and then were slain or died, God will give them a generous provision. Surely God is the Best of Providers."/>
		<aya index="59" text="He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well-pleased. For God is all knowing and most forbearing."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Thus it shall be. As for one who retaliates to the same extent as he has suffered and then is again wronged, God will surely come to his aid. God is merciful and forgiving."/>
		<aya index="61" text="That is because God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night. God is all hearing and all seeing."/>
		<aya index="62" text="That is because God is the Truth while anything they invoke besides God is sheer falsehood. God is the Sublime, the Great One."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Have you not seen how God sends down water from sky, whereupon the earth becomes green? God is unfathomable, and all aware;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="all that is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him. Surely, God is self-sufficient and praiseworthy."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Do you not see, how God has subjected everything on the earth to you, and the ships that sail on the sea by His command. He holds back the sky from falling down on the earth, except with His permission. God is most compassionate and most merciful to mankind --"/>
		<aya index="66" text="it is He who gave you life. Then He will cause you to die. Then He will give you life again. Surely, man is most ungrateful."/>
		<aya index="67" text="We have appointed for every community ways of worship to observe. Let them not dispute with you on this matter. Call them to the path of your Lord -- for surely, you are rightly guided --"/>
		<aya index="68" text="if they should dispute with you, then say, &quot;God is well aware of what you do.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="On the Day of Resurrection, God will judge between you regarding your differences."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Do you not know that God has knowledge of what the heavens and the earth contain? All is recorded in a Book; all this is easy for God."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Yet instead of God, they worship something for which God has sent no authority and about which they have no knowledge. The wrongdoers will have no helper."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, you will recognize the disgust on the faces of those who deny the truth. It is almost as if they are going to attack those who recite Our message to them. Say, &quot;Shall I tell you of something worse than this? It is the Fire that God has promised to those who are bent on denying the truth. What an evil destination!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="People, here is an illustration. So listen carefully. Surely, those whom you invoke other than God cannot create even a fly, even if they were all to combine together to do it, and if a fly should snatch anything away from them, they cannot recover it from it. Both are indeed weak, the seeker and the sought."/>
		<aya index="74" text="No just estimate have they made of God. Surely God is powerful and mighty."/>
		<aya index="75" text="God selects messengers from both angels and from mankind; God is all hearing and all seeing:"/>
		<aya index="76" text="He knows what lies ahead of them and what is behind them. All things shall return to God."/>
		<aya index="77" text="You who are true believers, kneel and prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord and do good works, so that you may succeed."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Strive for the cause of God as it behoves you to strive for it. He has chosen you and laid on you no burden in the matter of your religion, the faith of Abraham your forefather. In this, as in former scriptures He has given you the name of Muslims, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and so that you may be witnesses over mankind. Therefore, say your prayers  regularly and pay the zakat and hold fast to God. He is your master. An excellent master and an excellent helper!"/>

Thus God makes clear to you His revelations: God is all knowing and wise."/>

There is no objection to your eating together or separately. But when you enter houses, salute one another with a greeting of peace, a greeting from your Lord full of blessings and purity. Thus does God expound to you His commandments, so that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="62" text="They only are true believers who believe in God and His Messenger. When they are with him on some matter of common concern, they should not depart until they have asked him for permission to do so. Those who ask you for such permission are the ones who truly believe in God and His Messenger. When they ask you for permission to attend to some affair of their own, then grant it to whoever you please and seek forgiveness from God for them. God is forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Do not treat being called by the Messenger like being called by one another. God knows those of you who slip away on some pretext. Let those who go against his order beware lest some affliction befall them or they receive a painful punishment."/>

		<aya index="21" text="I shall surely punish him severely or order him to be executed, unless he gives me a good reason for his absence.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="But he was not long in coming, and said, &quot;I have learnt something you did not know. I have come to you from Sheba with reliable news."/>
		<aya index="23" text="I found a woman ruling over them, who has been given everything and she has a mighty throne."/>
		<aya index="24" text="I found her and her people worshipping the sun, instead of God. Satan has made their conduct appear good to them, and has thus diverted them from the right path, so that they might not be guided."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Should they not worship God who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and earth and knows both what you conceal and what you make known?"/>
		<aya index="26" text="He is God: there is no deity but He, the Lord of the mighty throne.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Solomon said, &quot;We shall soon see whether you have spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Go with this letter of mine and lay it before them, then withdraw from them and see how they respond.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="The Queen of Sheba said, &quot;O Counsellors, an honourable letter has been delivered to me."/>
		<aya index="30" text="It is from Solomon. It reads, &quot;In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful,"/>
		<aya index="31" text="do not exalt yourselves above me, but come to me in all submission.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Now advise me in this, Counsellors. I never decide any affair till I have conferred with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="They said, &quot;We are strong and our prowess in battle is great, but the decision is in your hands, so consider what you will command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="She said, &quot;Surely, when mighty kings invade a country, they despoil it and humiliate its noblest inhabitants, these men will do the same,"/>
		<aya index="35" text="but I shall send them a present and see with what reply my envoys will return.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="So when [the envoy] came to Solomon he said, &quot;What! Are you offering me wealth? But that which God has given me is better than that which He has given you. Yet you rejoice in your gift."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Go back to them: we shall most certainly come upon them with forces which they will never be able to withstand, and shall most certainly cause them to be driven from their lands, disgraced and humbled!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="Solomon then said, &quot;O Counsellors,  which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"/>
		<aya index="39" text="A demon from among the jinn said, &quot;I will bring it to you before you get up from your seat. I am strong and trustworthy enough to do it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="But one of them who had some knowledge of the Book said, &quot;I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye.&quot; When Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed, &quot;This is by the grace of my Lord, to test whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whosoever is grateful, it is for the good of his own self; and whosoever is ungrateful, then surely my Lord is self-sufficient and generous.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="41" text="He said, &quot;Disguise her throne. We shall see whether or not she will recognize it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="When she came to Solomon, she was asked, &quot;Is your throne like this?&quot; She replied, &quot;It looks as though it were the same, and we had been given knowledge [of your power] before this, and we have already submitted.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="And that which she used to worship beside God had stopped her [from believing]; for she came of a disbelieving people."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Then she was bidden to enter the palace; but when she saw it, she thought it was a deep pool of water, and bared her legs. But Solomon explained, &quot;It is just a palace paved with glass,&quot; and she said, &quot;My Lord, I have wronged myself: now I submit myself along with Solomon, to God, the Lord of the Universe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="To Thamud We sent their brother Salih. He said, &quot;Serve none but God.&quot; But they divided themselves into two factions contending with one another."/>
		<aya index="46" text="He urged them, &quot;O my people, why do you wish to hasten on the evil rather than the good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of God, so that you may be shown mercy?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="They said, &quot;We see you and your followers as an evil omen.&quot; He replied, &quot;No, your evil omen is with God; the truth is that you are a people being put to the test.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="There were in the city nine men who spread corruption in the land, and would not reform."/>
		<aya index="49" text="They said, &quot;Let us bind ourselves by an oath sworn in the name of God that we shall attack Salih and his family by night, and to his protector [who demands retribution], we shall say, &quot;We were not present when they were slain. We are telling the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="Thus they devised a plan, and We also devised a plan, but they were not aware of it."/>
		<aya index="51" text="See, then, what the consequences of their plan were. We destroyed them and their people utterly, all together."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Because of their wrongdoing, their houses are in ruins, in that surely there is a sign for people who have knowledge,"/>
		<aya index="53" text="and We saved those who believed in and feared God."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And tell of Lot. He said to his people, &quot;Will you commit evil knowingly?"/>
		<aya index="55" text="Must you go lustfully to men instead of women? Indeed, you are a people who are deeply ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="The only answer of his people was, &quot;Drive out Lot and his family from the city. They are a people who make themselves out to be pure.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="57" text="So We delivered him and his family, except his wife: We ordained her to be one of those who stayed behind,"/>
		<aya index="58" text="and We pelted them with torrential rain. How dreadful that rain was for those who had been warned!"/>
		<aya index="59" text="Say, &quot;All praise be to God, and peace be upon those servants of His whom He has chosen. Is God better, or what they associate with Him?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water for you from the sky, by which We make luxuriant gardens grow, you could never make such trees grow in them, is it another deity besides God? No indeed, but they are a people who equate others with Him."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Who is it that made the earth a stable place to live in? Who made rivers flow through it? Who set mountains upon it and placed a barrier between the two seas? Is there another deity besides God? Indeed, most of them have no knowledge."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Who responds to the oppressed when he calls out to Him, and relieves his suffering and who will make you inheritors of the earth? Then, is there a god besides God? How little you pay heed!"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea? Who sends the breezes as heralds of His mercy? Then, is there a deity besides God? Exalted is God above what they associate with Him."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Who originates creation, then regenerates it, and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? Then, is there a deity besides God?&quot; Say, &quot;Bring forward your proofs, if you are telling the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="Say, &quot;No one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unseen except God.&quot; They do not know when they will be raised up again."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Indeed, their knowledge of the life to come stops short of the truth: they are [often] in doubt as to its reality: in fact, they are blind to it."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Those who deny the truth say, &quot;When we have turned to dust like our fathers, shall we be brought back to life again?"/>
		<aya index="68" text="We and our fathers were promised this before; these are but old stories.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Say, &quot;Roam across the earth and observe what was the end of the sinful ones.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Do not grieve over them, nor feel distressed at their schemes."/>
		<aya index="71" text="They ask, &quot;When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say be true?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say, &quot;It may be that a part of what you would hasten on is close behind you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="Truly, your Lord is bountiful to mankind, but most of them are not grateful."/>
		<aya index="74" text="The Lord knows full well what they conceal in their hearts and what they disclose:"/>
		<aya index="75" text="there is nothing hidden in heaven and on earth, but is recorded in a clear Book."/>
		<aya index="76" text="This Quran explains to the children of Israel much of what they differ over,"/>
		<aya index="77" text="certainly it is guidance and a blessing for the believers."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Certainly your Lord will decide between them in His wisdom, He is the Almighty, the All Knowing,"/>
		<aya index="79" text="so put your trust in God. Surely you are on the path of manifest truth."/>
		<aya index="80" text="You cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear your call, when they turn their backs on it,"/>
		<aya index="81" text="nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can make only those hear you who believe in Our revelations and surrender themselves to Us."/>
		<aya index="82" text="When God's word is justly carried out against them, We will produce a dabbah from the earth which will tell them that mankind had no real faith in Our signs."/>
		<aya index="83" text="On that Day We shall assemble together a host from every community of those who cried lies to Our revelations and they will be grouped"/>
		<aya index="84" text="then, when they have arrived, He will say, &quot;Did you deny My revelations, even though you did not have proper knowledge of them? Or what was it that you were doing?&quot;"/>

		<aya index="2" text="These are verses from the Book that makes things clear."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We shall narrate to you some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh, with truth, for people who would believe."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Pharaoh behaved arrogantly in the land, and divided the people into groups, seeking to weaken one section, slaying their sons and sparing their daughters, he was one of those who spread corruption,"/>
		<aya index="5" text="We wished to favour those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them leaders and make them inheritors [of Our bounties],"/>
		<aya index="6" text="and to give them power in the land; and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that very thing which they feared."/>
		<aya index="7" text="We inspired Moses' mother saying, &quot;Suckle him, and then, when you fear for him, cast him into the river, and have no fear and do not grieve, for We shall return him to you, and shall make him one of the Messengers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then Pharaoh's household picked him up -- later to become for them an enemy and a source of grief for them: Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers --"/>
		<aya index="9" text="and Pharaoh's wife said, &quot;He will be a joy to the eye for me and you! Do not slay him: he may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son.&quot; They did not realize what they were doing."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Moses' mother's heart was full of anxiety -- she would have disclosed his identity had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be a firm believer [in Our promise]."/>
		<aya index="11" text="She said to Moses' sister, &quot;Go, and follow him.&quot; So she watched him from a distance, like a stranger, without anyone noticing her."/>
		<aya index="12" text="We had already made him refuse all wet nurses. So his sister said to them, &quot;Shall I tell you of a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of him?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Thus We restored him to his mother, so that she might be comforted and not grieve any more, and so that she would know that God's promise was true. But most of them do not realize this."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When Moses reached full manhood and maturity, We bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge: this is how We reward those who do good."/>
		<aya index="15" text="He entered the city unnoticed by its people, and there he encountered two men fighting with one another -- one of his own people and the other one of his enemies. The one who belonged to his own people cried out to him for help against his foe -- whereupon Moses struck him down with his fist, thereby causing his death. Moses said, &quot;This is Satan's doing; he is an open foe, leading man astray.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="He prayed, &quot;Forgive me Lord, for I have sinned against my soul.&quot; God forgave him; for He is the Forgiving One, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="17" text="He said, &quot;My Lord, because of the favour that You have shown me, I vow that I will never be a helper of the guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="The next morning, when he was walking in the city, apprehensive, and watchful, and the man who had sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses said to him, &quot;You are clearly a misguided man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="When he wanted to catch the one who was an enemy to them both, the man said, &quot;Moses, do you want to kill me just as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to become a tyrant in the land; you do not want to set things right.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="20" text="A man came running from the far side of the city, and said, &quot;Moses, the authorities are conspiring to kill you, so leave the city. I am one of your well-wishers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="So Moses departed from the city, fearful and vigilant, and prayed, &quot;My Lord, save me from these unjust people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="When he made his way towards Midian, he said, &quot;I am sure, my Lord will guide me to the right way.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="And when he arrived at the well of Midian, he found around it a group of men watering their flocks, and he saw two women standing apart from them, who were holding back their flocks, so he asked, &quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; They replied, &quot;We cannot draw water until the shepherds take away their sheep. Our father is a very old man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="So Moses watered their flocks for them; and returned into the shade and prayed, &quot;Lord, I am truly in need of whatever blessing You may send down for me,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="and then one of the two women came walking shyly up to him and said, &quot;My father is asking you to come so that he may reward you for watering our flocks for us.&quot; When Moses came to their father and gave him an account of himself, he said: &quot;Don't be afraid! You have escaped from those wrongdoing people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="One of the girls said, &quot;Father, hire him! For the best man to hire is someone strong and trustworthy.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="The father said, &quot;I would like to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine on the condition that you stay eight years in my service. But if you wish it, you may stay ten. I do not want to impose any hardship on you. God willing, you will find me a fair person.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="Moses said, &quot;That is agreed between me and you; whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no blame on me. God is witness to what we say.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="When Moses completed the term and set out with his family, he noticed a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: &quot;Stay here, I can see a fire. Perhaps I can bring you news, or a burning brand from the fire with which you may warm yourself.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="And when he came to it, he was called by a voice from a bush in a blessed spot, on the right side of the valley: &quot;O Moses, I am God, Lord of the Universe."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Throw down your staff.&quot; And when he saw it move as though it were a serpent, he turned his back and fled, and did not look back. &quot;O Moses,&quot; said the voice, &quot;come forward and have no fear; you are quite safe."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Put your hand into your bosom; it will come out [shining] white, without blemish; now draw your arm close to your body to calm your fears. These are two credentials from your Lord for Pharaoh and his nobles. Surely, they are a rebellious people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Moses said, &quot;My Lord, I have killed one of their people and fear that they may kill me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="My brother Aaron is more eloquent than I am. Send him with me to support me and back me up. For I fear that they will reject me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="God said: &quot;We shall strengthen your arm through your brother, We shall give you both power, so that they shall not be able to harm you. Set forth with Our signs. You, and those who follow you, will surely prevail.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, &quot;This is nothing but contrived magic. We never heard of this among our forefathers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="And Moses replied, &quot;My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him and who will attain the heavenly abode in the hereafter. The wrongdoers shall never prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="Pharaoh said, &quot;O nobles, I know of no god for you other than myself. So, Haman, burn me bricks of clay, and build me a high tower, so that I may have a look at the God of Moses, though I consider him to be one of the liars.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="He and his hosts behaved arrogantly in the land without any justification, thinking that they would not be recalled to Us,"/>
		<aya index="40" text="so We seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea. Consider the fate of the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="41" text="We had made them leaders, but they called people to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped."/>
		<aya index="42" text="We have caused a curse to follow them in this world and, on the Day of Judgement, they will be among the wretched."/>
		<aya index="43" text="After We had destroyed the earlier generations, We gave Moses the Book to give men insight, and as guidance and a blessing for people, so that they might take heed."/>
		<aya index="44" text="You were not present on the western side of the Mount when We gave Our Command to Moses: nor were you among the witnesses,"/>
		<aya index="45" text="We brought into being many generations who lived long lives, nor did you live among the people of Midian and recite our revelations to them, it is We who send messengers,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="you were not on the side of the Mount when We called out to Moses, but We have sent you as a mercy from your Lord, so that you may warn people to whom no warner has been sent before you, so that they may take heed,"/>
		<aya index="47" text="and may not say, if an affliction should befall them on account of their misdeeds: &quot;Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we might have followed Your message and become believers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, &quot;Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?&quot; But did they not reject what Moses was given before? They said, &quot;Both [Moses and Muhammad] are kinds of sorcery, each assisting the other.&quot; And they add, &quot;We reject both of them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say to them, &quot;Bring down from God a scripture that is a better guide than these two and I will follow it, if what you say be true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="If they do not respond to you, then know that they follow only their own desires. Who could be more astray than he who follows his own likes and dislikes with no guidance from God? God does not guide the evil-doers."/>
		<aya index="51" text="We have conveyed Our Word to them, in succession, so that they may give heed."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Those to whom We gave the Book before this believe in it [the Quran],"/>
		<aya index="53" text="and, when it is recited to them, they say, &quot;We believe in it. Indeed it is the truth from our Lord. Even before it came, we had submitted ourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="Such people as these will receive a double reward, because they are steadfast and repel evil with good, and give alms out of what We have given them,"/>
		<aya index="55" text="and when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, &quot;We have our actions and you have yours. We wish you peace. We will have nothing to do with the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="You cannot guide whoever you please: it is God who guides whom He will. He best knows those who would accept guidance."/>
		<aya index="57" text="They say, &quot;If we were to follow your guidance, we should be uprooted from our land.&quot; But have We not established for them a safe haven to which fruits of every kind are brought as a provision from Ourself? But most of them have no knowledge."/>
		<aya index="58" text="How many townships have We destroyed where the people had become arrogant on account of their affluence? Since then their dwelling-places have scarcely been inhabited -- We became their inheritors."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Your Lord would never destroy a people until He had sent messengers to their capital cities, reciting to them Our revelations. Nor did We destroy a town unless their people became wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Whatever you are given in this life is nothing but a temporary provision of this life and its glitter; what God has is better and more lasting. Will you not then understand?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Can someone to whom We have made a gracious promise and who will see it fulfilled, be compared to someone We have allowed to enjoy a worldly life, awhile, and who will be brought up [before God] for his accounting on the Day of Resurrection?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="On that Day He will call to them, and say, &quot;Where are those whom you claimed to be My partners?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="And those on whom sentence has been passed, will say, &quot;Our Lord, these are the ones who led us astray. We led them astray as we ourselves were led astray. We now dissociate ourselves from them before You; it was not us that they worshipped.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then they will be told, &quot;Call upon your partners.&quot; And they will call upon them, but will receive no answer. They shall witness the punishment. If only they had allowed themselves to be guided."/>
		<aya index="65" text="On that Day God will call out to them, saying, &quot;What answer did you give to Our messengers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="They will be left speechless on that Day, and they will not be able to consult each other."/>
		<aya index="67" text="But as for him who repents and believes and does good deeds, he can hope to find himself among the successful."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses whomsoever He pleases. They have no choice. Praise be to God -- exalted is He over anything they may associate with Him!"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Your Lord knows what they conceal in their hearts and what they disclose."/>
		<aya index="70" text="He is God: there is no god but Him. All Praise is due to Him in this world and the hereafter. His is the Judgement and to Him you shall be returned."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Ask them, &quot;Tell me, if God were to extend perpetual night over you till the Day of Judgement, is there any deity other than God that could bring you light? Will you not listen?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say, &quot;Tell me, if God were to extend perpetual day over you till the Day of Judgement -- is there any deity other than God that could bring you night, in which to rest? Will you not then see?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="In His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, during which you may rest, and seek His bounty and be grateful."/>
		<aya index="74" text="And on the Day He shall call out to them and say, &quot;Where are those whom you alleged were My partners.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="And We shall bring forth from every people a witness and We shall say to them: &quot;Bring your proof.&quot; Then they will know that truth belongs to God alone, and that which they used to invent will fall away from them."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Korah was one of Moses' people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had given him such treasures that their very keys would have weighed down a band of strong men. His people said to him, &quot;Do not exult in your riches, for God does not love the exultant."/>
		<aya index="77" text="But seek the Home of the Hereafter by means of that which God has bestowed on you; do not forget to take your portion [of the Hereafter] in this world.&quot; Be good to others as God has been good to you and do not strive for evil in the land, for God does not love the evil-doers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="But he said, &quot;I have been given it only because of the knowledge I possess.&quot; Did he not know that God had destroyed before him people who were stronger than he and possessed even greater resources? The guilty are not required to offer explanations of their sins."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Then he went forth before his people in all his pomp. Those who were eager for the life of this world said, &quot;If only we had the like of Korah's fortune! He really is a very fortunate man,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="80" text="but those who had been given knowledge said, &quot;Woe to you, God's reward is better for those who believe and do good deeds: and it is awarded only to those who are steadfast.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his home: there was no one to help him against God, nor could he defend himself."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Those who had coveted his position the day before now began to say, &quot;Ah! It is indeed God alone who gives abundantly to whom He will and sparingly to whom He pleases. Had not God been gracious to us, He would have caused us to be swallowed up also.&quot; Alas indeed! Those who deny the truth will never prosper."/>
		<aya index="83" text="As for the abode of the Hereafter, We shall assign it to those who seek neither self-aggrandisement on the earth nor corruption. The righteous shall have a blessed end."/>
		<aya index="84" text="He who does good shall be rewarded with something better. But he who does evil shall be requited according to his deeds."/>
		<aya index="85" text="He who has entrusted you with the responsibility of the Quran, will surely lead you to a successful end. Say, &quot;My Lord knows best who is rightly guided and who is in gross error.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="You never expected that this Book would be revealed to you. Yet, by the grace of your Lord, you have received it. So do not support those who reject the truth."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And let no one divert you from God's revelations, once they have been sent down to you. Call people to your Lord. Never be of those who ascribe partners to God."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Invoke no god other than God, for there is no god but Him. All things are bound to perish except Himself. His is the judgement, and to Him you shall be returned."/>

		<aya index="2" text="Do people think that once they say, &quot;We believe,&quot; they will be left alone and not be put to the test?"/>
		<aya index="3" text="We certainly tried those who have gone before them, so God will certainly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are lying."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Do those who do evil imagine that they will escape Us? How ill they judge!"/>
		<aya index="5" text="He who hopes to meet God should know that God's appointed hour is sure to come. He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing."/>
		<aya index="6" text="And whoever strives, strives only for himself, God is independent of all His creation,"/>
		<aya index="7" text="as for those who have faith and do good works, We shall certainly cleanse them of their evil deeds and reward them according to the best of their actions."/>
		<aya index="8" text="We have enjoined man to show kindness to his parents. But if they bid you associate with Me something about which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. To Me you shall all return, and I shall tell you about all that you have done."/>
		<aya index="9" text="We shall surely admit those who believe and do good deeds to the company of the righteous."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Some profess to believe in God, but when they suffer for God's cause they mistake the persecution of man for the punishment of God. But when help comes to you from God, they will say, &quot;We have always been with you.&quot; Is not God fully aware of what is in the hearts of all creatures?"/>
		<aya index="11" text="Most certainly God will mark out those who believe and mark out those who are hypocrites."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Those who deny the truth say to the faithful, &quot;Follow our way, and we will bear the burden of your sins.&quot; But they will bear none of their sins. They are surely lying."/>
		<aya index="13" text="They shall bear their own burdens, and other burdens besides. On the Day of Resurrection they shall be questioned about their false assertions."/>
		<aya index="14" text="We sent Noah to his people and he lived among them for fifty short of a thousand years; then the deluge overtook them, for they were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="15" text="But We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark and made the event a sign for mankind."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Tell of Abraham. He said to his people, &quot;Worship God and fear Him, that would be best for you, if only you knew."/>
		<aya index="17" text="You worship idols besides God and fabricate falsehoods. Those whom you worship besides God have no power to provide sustenance for you. So seek your sustenance from God and worship Him and be grateful to Him, for to Him you shall return."/>
		<aya index="18" text="If you reject the truth, other communities before you also rejected the truth. The messenger's responsibility is only to convey the message clearly.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="Do they not see how God originates creation, then reproduces it? That surely is easy for God."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Tell them, &quot;Roam the earth and see how He originated creation. Then God will bring into being your second life. God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="He punishes whom He will and shows mercy to whom He pleases. And to Him you shall be returned."/>
		<aya index="22" text="You cannot defeat His purpose on earth or in heaven; nor have you any friend or helper besides God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="Those who deny God's revelations and the meeting with Him -- it is they who have despaired of My mercy. They will suffer a grievous punishment."/>
		<aya index="24" text="The only response of Abraham's people was, &quot;Kill him or burn him!&quot; But God saved him from the fire. Surely in this there are signs for people who believe."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Abraham said, &quot;You have taken up the worship of idols, instead of God, to promote friendship between yourselves in the present life. But on the Day of Judgement, you will disown and curse one another. Your abode will be the Fire and you will have no helpers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Lot was the one who believed in him and said, &quot;I shall migrate to another land for the sake of my Lord. He is the Mighty One, the Wise One.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="We gave him Isaac and Jacob and granted prophethood and the Book to his descendants. We gave him his reward in this life and in the Hereafter he shall dwell among the righteous."/>
		<aya index="28" text="We sent Lot to his people and he said to them, &quot;Indeed you commit obscenity such as no people before you have ever committed."/>
		<aya index="29" text="You approach men and waylay them on the road and commit depravities within your gatherings.&quot; But his people's only reply was, &quot;Bring down God's punishment upon us, if what you say be true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Lot prayed, &quot;Lord, help me against this wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="When Our messengers brought Abraham the good news [of the birth of Isaac] they [also] said, &quot;We are indeed going to destroy the people of this city, for the people of this city are truly wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Abraham said, &quot;But, Lot lives here.&quot; They answered, &quot;We well know who lives here. We shall surely save him and his whole family, except his wife, who will be among those who stay behind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="When Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled and distressed on their account. They said, &quot;Have no fear or grief. We shall certainly save you and your household, except your wife, who will be among those who stay behind,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="We are surely going to bring down a punishment from heaven on the people of this town because of their depravities.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Surely the ruins We left of that city are a clear sign for a people who use their reason."/>
		<aya index="36" text="To the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu'ayb. He said, &quot;My people, worship God, and look forward to the Last Day, and do not commit evil and spread corruption in the land.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="But they rejected him, so the earthquake overwhelmed them and they were left lying prostrate on the ground in their homes."/>
		<aya index="38" text="The same happened to the tribes of 'Ad and Thamud: this must be clear to you from their ruins. Satan made their actions seem good to them, and turned them away from the straight path, even though they were intelligent people."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Korah, Pharaoh, and Haman: Moses came to them with clear signs but they were arrogant in the land. They could not escape Us."/>
		<aya index="40" text="So We seized each one for his sins; some We struck with a violent storm; some of them were overcome by a sudden blast, some were swallowed up by the earth and some We drowned. God did not wrong them: they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Those who take protectors other than God can be compared to the spider which builds itself a cobweb, but the frailest of all structures is the house of the spider, if they but knew it."/>
		<aya index="42" text="God surely knows what they invoke besides Him. He is the Mighty, the Wise One."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Such are the comparisons We make for people, but only those understand them who have knowledge."/>
		<aya index="44" text="God has created the heavens and the earth for a purpose; surely in this there is a sign for true believers."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Recite what has been revealed to you of the book, and pray regularly. Surely prayer restrains one from indecency and evil and remembrance of God is greater. God has knowledge of all your actions."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Believers, argue only in the best way with the People of the Book, [but contend not at all] with such of them as are unjust. Say, &quot;We believe in what has been revealed to us, and what has been revealed to you; our God and your God are one; and to Him we submit.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Likewise We have sent down the Book to you. Those to whom We gave the scripture believe in it, and so do some of your own people. Only those who deny the truth reject Our revelations."/>
		<aya index="48" text="You were not able to read any book before this, nor did you write one down with your hand. If you had done so, the followers of falsehood would have had cause to doubt it."/>
		<aya index="49" text="But the Quran is a revelation that is clear to the hearts of those endowed with knowledge. Only the evil-doers refuse to acknowledge Our revelations."/>
		<aya index="50" text="They say, &quot;Why has no sign been given to him by his Lord?&quot; Say, &quot;The signs are in the hands of God. I am but a plain warner.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent you down the Book to be recited to them? In this surely there is a blessing and an admonition for a people who believe."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Say, &quot;God is sufficient as a witness between you and me. He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth. Those who believe in falsehood and reject God will surely be the losers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="They ask you to hasten the punishment. Had there not been an appointed time for it, the punishment would already have come to them. Indeed it will come down upon them suddenly and catch them unawares."/>
		<aya index="54" text="They ask you to hasten the punishment, but surely, Hell is [already] encompassing those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="55" text="On the Day the punishment envelops them from above them and from underneath their feet, they will be told, &quot;Taste [the punishment] for what you used to do!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="56" text="My servants who believe, My earth is vast, so worship Me alone."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Every soul shall taste death and then to Us you shall return."/>
		<aya index="58" text="We shall lodge forever those who believe and do good works in the mansions of Paradise beside which rivers flow. How excellent is the reward of those who labour,"/>
		<aya index="59" text="and who are steadfast and put their trust in their Lord."/>
		<aya index="60" text="How many creatures cannot fend for themselves! God provides for them and for you. He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing."/>
		<aya index="61" text="If you ask them who it is that has created the heavens and the earth and subjugated the sun and the moon, they will say, &quot;God.&quot; How then are they turned away?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="God gives abundantly to whom He will and sparingly to whom He pleases. God has full knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And if you ask them who it is that sends down water from the sky and revives the earth with it after its death, they will surely answer, &quot;God.&quot; Then praise be to God. But most of them do not understand."/>
		<aya index="64" text="The life of this world is nothing but sport and a diversion. It is the life of the Hereafter which is the only true life, if they but knew it."/>
		<aya index="65" text="When they board a vessel, they call on God, sincere in their faith for Him alone; but when He brings them safe to land, they begin to ascribe partners to Him."/>
		<aya index="66" text="And thus they may show utter ingratitude for Our favours; let them enjoy themselves for a time. But they will soon come to know."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Have they not seen how We have granted them a safe sanctuary, though all around them people are snatched away? Would they still believe in falsehood, and deny the favour of God?"/>
		<aya index="68" text="Who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie about God or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is Hell not the home for those who deny the truth."/>
		<aya index="69" text="We will surely guide in Our ways those who strive hard for Our cause, God is surely with the righteous."/>

		<aya index="6" text="[This is] God's promise. Never does God fail to fulfil His promise -- but most people do not know this;"/>
		<aya index="7" text="they only know the outward appearance of the life of this world, and they are neglectful of the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Do they not ponder about their own selves? God has created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for a purpose and for an appointed time? Yet many deny they will ever meet with their Lord."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Have they not travelled through the land and seen what end their predecessors met? They were mightier than them: they cultivated the earth more and built more upon it than these have ever built. Their own messengers also came to them with clear signs: God did not wrong them; they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Then the end of those who committed evil was evil, for they belied the signs of God, and they derided them."/>
		<aya index="11" text="God originates the creation, and shall repeat it, then to Him you shall be returned."/>
		<aya index="12" text="On the Day the Hour arrives, the guilty will be struck dumb with despair,"/>

		<aya index="19" text="He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. He gives life to the earth after its death, and you shall be raised to life in the same way."/>
		<aya index="20" text="One of His signs is that He created you from dust and, behold, you became human beings and multiplied yourselves throughout the earth."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Another of His signs is that He created for you from among yourselves spouses, so that you might find repose in them, and He created between you affection and kindness. Truly there are signs in this for people who reflect."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Another of His signs is that He created the heavens and earth, and the diversity of your languages and colours. There truly are signs in this for those who know."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Among His signs are your sleep, at night or in daytime, and your seeking His bounty. There truly are signs in this for people who hear."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Among His signs is this: He shows you the lightning, giving rise to [both] fear and hope, and sends down water from the sky, giving life thereby to the earth after it had been lifeless: in this, behold, there are signs indeed for people who use their reason!"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Another of His signs is this: the heavens and the earth stand firm by His command and afterwards when He calls you, behold, from the earth you will come forth."/>
		<aya index="26" text="All those in the heavens and on the earth belong to Him. All are obedient to Him."/>
		<aya index="27" text="He is the One who originates creation, then repeats it, and it is very easy for Him. His is the most exalted state in the heavens and on the earth; He is the Mighty, the Wise One."/>
		<aya index="28" text="He sets forth for you an example taken from your own lives. Do you make your servants full partners with an equal share in the wealth We have bestowed upon you? Do you fear them as you fear each other? In this way We explain the signs to people who use their reason."/>
		<aya index="29" text="And still those who are unjust follow their own desires without having any knowledge. Then who can guide those whom God has let go astray? There shall be none to help them."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Devote yourself single-mindedly to the Religion. And follow the nature [constitution] as made by God, that nature in which He has created mankind. There is no altering the creation of God. That is the right religion. But most people do not realize it."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Turn to Him and fear Him, and be steadfast in prayer, and do not be one of those who associate partners with God,"/>
		<aya index="32" text="those who split up their religion and became divided into sects; each one exulting in what they have."/>
		<aya index="33" text="When an affliction befalls men, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him in repentance; but then, when He has made them taste His mercy, a section of them associate partners with their Lord,"/>

		<aya index="35" text="Have We sent down to them any authority which speaks in favour of what they associate with Him?"/>

		<aya index="38" text="So give the near relative, the needy, and the wayfarer their due -- that is best for those who seek God's pleasure: such men are the ones who will surely prosper."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Whatever you lend out in usury to gain in value through other people's wealth will not increase in God's eyes, but whatever you give in alms in your desire for God's pleasure will be multiplied."/>

		<aya index="42" text="Say, &quot;Journey through the land, and see how those before you met their end -- most of them, ascribed partners with God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="[Prophet], set your face to the right religion, before that Day comes from God which cannot be averted. On that Day, mankind will be parted in two."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Those who rejected the truth will bear the burden of that rejection, and those who did good deeds will have made good provision for themselves."/>
		<aya index="45" text="For then He will reward out of His bounty those who believe and do good deeds; He does not love those who reject the truth."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Among His signs is this: He sends out the winds bearing good news so that He may make you taste His mercy, and ships sail at His command, so that you may seek His bounty, and be grateful."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Surely, We sent messengers before you to their own people, and they brought them clear signs. Then We took vengeance on the guilty. It was certainly Our duty to help the believers."/>
		<aya index="48" text="It is God who sends out the winds so that they raise the clouds. Then He spreads them in the sky as He wills and places them layer upon layer and you see the rain issuing forth from their midst. When He causes it to fall on whichever of His servants He pleases, behold! they rejoice;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="though before that, before it was sent down upon them, they were in despair."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Look, therefore, at the signs of God's mercy; how He resurrects the earth after its death. Truly, the same God will resurrect the dead; for He has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Yet if We send a wind and they see their harvest turn yellow, they will then begin to deny [Our favours]."/>
		<aya index="52" text="You [Prophet] cannot make the dead hear and you cannot make the deaf hear your call when they turn their backs and leave;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="just as you cannot lead the blind [of heart] out of their error, you cannot make anyone hear your call save those who are willing to believe in Our revelations, and thus surrender themselves to Us and are submissive to Our will."/>
		<aya index="54" text="God is the One who has created you in a state of weakness; then He has granted you strength following [your] weakness; later on He has given you infirmity and grey hairs in place of strength. He creates whatever He wishes; He is the All Knowing and All Powerful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="On the Day the Last Hour arrives, the evil-doers will swear they have not even tarried for an hour, they have always been deluded,"/>

		<aya index="57" text="So on that Day their pleas shall be of no avail, nor will they be allowed to make amends."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Truly, We have set forth for men in this Quran every kind of parable and indeed, if you bring them a sign, those who are bent on denying the truth are sure to say, &quot;You are only making false claims!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="In this way God seals the hearts of those who do not [want to] know [the truth],"/>
		<aya index="60" text="so have patience [O Muhammad]! God's promise is true; let not those who will not be convinced make you discouraged."/>

		<aya index="6" text="The Prophet has a higher claim on the believers than [they have on] their own selves, and his wives are their mothers.

		<aya index="19" text="Begrudging you all help, but when danger comes, you can see them looking at you with rolling eyes as if in their death throes; but once their fear has passed, they come to you and do glib-talking in their greed for wealth. Such men have no faith, so God has foiled their actions. This is indeed easy for God."/>

Women of the [Prophet&quot;s] Household, God seeks only to remove all impurity from you, and to make you completely pure."/>

		<aya index="36" text="It is not fitting for a believing man or woman to exercise any choice in his or her own affairs once God and His Messenger have reached a decision upon them. Anyone who disobeys God and His Messenger is in manifest error."/>
		<aya index="37" text="You said to the man who had been favoured by God and by you, &quot;Keep your wife to yourself and have fear of God.&quot; You sought to hide in your heart what God wished to reveal. You were afraid of people, whereas it would have been more proper to fear God. When Zayd divorced his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there should be no restriction on believers marrying the spouses of their adopted sons when they have divorced them. The commandment of God must be fulfilled."/>
		<aya index="38" text="No blame shall be attached to the Prophet for doing what is sanctioned for him by God. This was God's way with those who went before him -- and the command of God is a decree determined."/>

		<aya index="50" text="Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have given their dowers, as well as those whom your right hand possesses from among the captives of war whom God has bestowed upon you. and [We have made lawful to you] the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who have migrated with you; and any believing woman who gives herself to the Prophet, provided the Prophet wants to marry her. This applies only to you and not to the rest of the believers. We know what We have prescribed for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands may possess, in order that there may be no blame on you. God is most forgiving, most merciful."/>
		<aya index="51" text="You may defer [the turn of] any of them that you please, and you may receive any you please: and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose [turn] you have set aside. That is more proper, so that their eyes may be cooled, and so that they may not grieve, and so that they will be satisfied with what you have given them. God knows what is in your hearts; and God is all knowing, and forbearing."/>

		<aya index="53" text="Believers, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are invited for a meal. Do not linger until a meal is ready. When you are invited enter and when you have taken your meal, depart. Do not stay on, indulging in conversation. Doing that causes annoyance to the Prophet, though he is too reticent to tell you so, but God is not reticent with the truth. When you ask [the wives of the Prophet] for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. That will be purer for your hearts as well as their hearts. It is not right for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger of God or for you ever to marry his wives after him. Indeed that would be an enormity in the sight of God."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Whether you reveal anything or hide it, God is aware of everything."/>
		<aya index="55" text="There shall be no blame on them for appearing before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women or those whom their right hands may possess. Women, fear God. God observes all things."/>
		<aya index="56" text="God and His angels bestow blessings on the Prophet. O believers, you also should invoke blessings on him and give him greetings of peace."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Those who annoy God and His Messenger shall be cursed by God in this world and in the Hereafter. God has prepared for them a humiliating punishment."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Those who affront believing men and believing women without their having deserved it [done any wrong] shall bear the weight of slander and flagrant sin."/>
		<aya index="59" text="O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and wives of the believers that they should draw over themselves some of their outer garments [when in public], so as to be recognized and not harmed. God is most forgiving and most merciful."/>
		<aya index="60" text="If the hypocrites and those who have tainted hearts and the scandal mongers of Madinah do not desist, We shall surely give you authority over them and their days in that city will be numbered."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Accursed, wherever they are found, they will be seized and killed."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Such has been God's way with those who have gone before them. You shall find no change in the ways of God."/>

		<aya index="64" text="God has rejected those who deny the truth and prepared for them a blazing Fire."/>
		<aya index="65" text="There they will live forever, and they will find therein neither friend nor helper."/>
		<aya index="66" text="On the Day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they shall say: &quot;Oh, would that we had obeyed God, and obeyed the Messenger!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="They shall say, &quot;Our Lord, we paid heed to our leaders and our elders, but they led us away from the right path."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Our Lord, give them double punishment and curse them with a mighty curse.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Believers, do not behave like those who slandered Moses. God cleared him of their allegations. He was honourable in the sight of God."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Believers, fear God, and say the right word."/>
		<aya index="71" text="He will bless your works for you and forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great success."/>
		<aya index="72" text="We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it, because they were afraid of it. But man bore it: he surely proved unjust and ignorant."/>
		<aya index="73" text="God will punish the hypocrites, both men and women, and polytheists, both men and women, but God will turn in His mercy to believing men and believing women; God is most forgiving and most merciful."/>

		<aya index="6" text="Surely Satan is your enemy: so treat him as an enemy: he calls on his followers only so that they should become inmates of the burning Fire."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Those who are bent on denying the truth will have a severe punishment, while those who believe and do good deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Is he whose evil deeds are made alluring to him so that he looks upon them as good, [equal to the man who is rightly guided]? God leaves to stray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. Do not destroy yourself with grief for them. God has full knowledge of all their actions."/>
		<aya index="9" text="It is God who sends forth the winds so that they raise up the clouds. We drive them to a dead land, and by them bring the earth to life after its death. Such is the Resurrection."/>
		<aya index="10" text="If anyone seeks glory, let him know that glory belongs to God alone. Good words ascend to Him and righteous deeds are exalted by Him. Those who plot evil deeds shall be sternly punished and their plotting will come to nothing."/>
		<aya index="11" text="God has created you from dust, then from a drop of semen and then divided you into pairs; no female conceives or gives birth without His knowledge; and no one's life is prolonged or shortened, but it is recorded in a Book. That surely is easy for God."/>
		<aya index="12" text="The two seas are not alike. The one is sweet, thirst-quenching, and pleasant to drink from, while the other is salty and bitter. Yet from each you eat fresh fish and extract ornaments to wear, and in each you see the ships ploughing through the waves so that you may seek His bounty and so that you may feel thankful."/>
		<aya index="13" text="He makes the night pass into the day and He makes the day pass into the night. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. Such is God, your Lord: His is the kingdom. Those whom you invoke besides Him do not own so much as the skin of a date stone;"/>
		<aya index="14" text="if you invoke them, they do not hear your call; and even if they could hear, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your having associated them with God. No one can tell you [the Truth] like the One who is all knowing."/>

		<aya index="16" text="if He so wished, He could take you away and replace you with a new creation;"/>
		<aya index="17" text="that is not difficult for God."/>
		<aya index="18" text="No burden-bearer shall bear another's burden, and if some over-laden soul should call out for someone else to carry his load, not the least portion of it will be borne for him, even though he were a near relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in the unseen, and pray regularly. Anyone who purifies himself will benefit greatly from doing so. To God all shall return."/>
		<aya index="19" text="The blind and the sighted are not equal,"/>
		<aya index="20" text="nor are the darkness and the light;"/>

		<aya index="23" text="You are but a warner,"/>
		<aya index="24" text="We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner, there is no community to which a warner has not come."/>
		<aya index="25" text="If they reject you, so did their predecessors. Messengers came to them with clear signs, with scriptures, and with the enlightening Book,"/>
		<aya index="26" text="but in the end I seized those who were bent on denying the truth and how terrible was My punishment."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Did you not see how God sent down water from the sky with which We bring forth fruit of diverse colours. In the mountains there are streaks of various shades of white and red, and jet-black rocks;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="in like manner, men, beasts, and cattle have their diverse hues too. Only those of His servants, who possess knowledge, fear God. God is almighty and most forgiving."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Those who read the Book of God and attend to their prayers and spend in charity in private and in public out of what We have provided them, may hope for a commerce that suffers no loss."/>
		<aya index="30" text="He will give them their full rewards and give them more out of His bounty. He is forgiving and appreciative."/>
		<aya index="31" text="The Book which We have revealed to you is the truth confirming previous scriptures. God knows and observes His servants."/>
		<aya index="32" text="We have bestowed the Book on those of Our servants whom We have chosen. Some wrong their own souls, some keep half-way [between right and wrong]; some, by God's leave, excel others in good deeds. This is a great bounty of God:"/>
		<aya index="33" text="they shall enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and wear silk garments."/>
		<aya index="34" text="They will say, &quot;Praise be to God who has taken away all sorrow from us. Our Lord is forgiving and appreciative."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Through His grace He has admitted us to the everlasting Abode, where neither toil nor weariness affects us.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Those who deny the truth shall remain in the fire of Hell. Death will not be decreed for them, so that they could escape by way of death, nor will its torment ever be eased for them. Thus do We requite every ungrateful person."/>
		<aya index="37" text="There they will cry out, &quot;Lord, take us out! We shall do good deeds, and behave differently from the way we used to.&quot; But He will answer, &quot;Did We not make your life long enough to take warning if you were going to? The warner did come to you. So now have a taste of the punishment.&quot; Wrongdoers will have no supporter."/>
		<aya index="38" text="God knows the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth. He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts of men;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="it is He who has made you inherit the earth. He who denies Him shall bear the burden of his denial. God's displeasure with the deniers will only be increased by their denial of the truth, it will only increase their loss."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Say, &quot;Have you ever considered your associate gods whom you call on besides God? Show me what it is that they have created on earth. Or have they a share in the creation of the heavens?&quot; Or have We given them a book so that they may act on evidence from it? Indeed, the wrongdoers' promises to one another are nothing but deception."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Surely, God holds the heavens and the earth, lest they should deviate [from their places]. Were they to deviate, none could hold them after Him. Surely, He is forbearing and most forgiving."/>
		<aya index="42" text="They swore their most solemn oaths that if a warner should ever come to them, they would be better guided than any other community. But when a warner did come to them, it only increased their aversion,"/>
		<aya index="43" text="and they behaved arrogantly in the land and plotted evil. But the plotting of evil only rebounds on those who plot. Are they but looking for the way the previous peoples [sinners] were dealt with? You will never find any change in the ways of God; nor will you ever find God's decree averted."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Have they not travelled around the earth and seen the fate of those who preceded them? And they were far superior to them in strength. Nothing in the heavens or the earth can ever frustrate God's [plans]. He is all-knowing and all powerful."/>
		<aya index="45" text="If God were to take men to task for their misdeeds, He would not leave a single living creature on the surface of the earth; but He grants them respite until an appointed time; and when their appointed time comes, then they will know that God is indeed observant of all His servants."/>

		<aya index="14" text="They became divided only after knowledge had reached them, out of mutual jealousy. Had it not been for a decree already passed by your Lord, [to reprieve them] till a specified period, the matter would surely have been decided between them. Those who inherited the Book after them are indeed in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion about it."/>
		<aya index="15" text="So call people to that faith and hold fast to it yourself as you are commanded, and do not be led by their desires, but say, &quot;I believe in the Book which God has sent down, and I am commanded to do justice between you: God is our Lord and your Lord; we are responsible for what we do and you are responsible for what you do. There is no contention between us and you. God will gather us together, for to Him we shall return.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="As for those who argue about God after He has been accepted, their arguments will carry no weight with their Lord, and His wrath will fall upon them. Severe punishment awaits them."/>

		<aya index="18" text="Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, but those who believe in it dread it, and know it to be the truth. Those who dispute the Hour have gone far astray."/>
		<aya index="19" text="God is most Gracious to His creatures: He provides sustenance for whoever He wills -- for He alone is the Powerful One, the Almighty."/>
		<aya index="20" text="To him who desires a harvest in the life to come, We shall grant an increase in his harvest; whereas to him who desires [but] a harvest in this world, We [may] give something thereof -- but he will have no share in [the blessings of] the life to come."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Do they have associate gods who have laid down for them a religion without the permission of God? Had it not been for God's decree on the final Judgement, the matter would have been decided between them. Surely the wrongdoers shall have a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="22" text="You will see the wrongdoers fearful of the consequences of their deeds, which will be inescapable. Whereas, those who have believed and done righteous deeds, will be in the meadows of the Garden and shall have whatever they desire from their Lord. That will be the supreme favour."/>

Say, &quot;I do not ask of you any reward for it, except [that I am inviting you to God because of] love of kinship.&quot; Whoever earns a good deed, We shall increase its good for him; God is most forgiving, most appreciative."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Do they say, &quot;He has invented a lie about God&quot;? If God so willed, He could seal your heart. God wipes out falsehood and vindicates the truth by His words. He has full knowledge of what is in men's hearts --"/>
		<aya index="25" text="He accepts repentance from His servants and pardons their sins. He knows everything you do."/>
		<aya index="26" text="He responds to those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more of His bounty; agonizing torment awaits the  deniers of the truth."/>
		<aya index="27" text="If God were to grant His abundant provision to [all] His creatures, they would act insolently on earth, but He sends down in due measure whatever He will, for He is well aware of His servants and watchful over them:"/>
		<aya index="28" text="it is He who sends rain after they have despaired and spreads His mercy far and wide. He is the Protector, Worthy of All Praise."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and all the living creatures He has dispersed throughout them: He has the power to gather them all together whenever He will."/>

		<aya index="33" text="if He willed, He could bring the wind to a standstill and they would lie motionless on the surface of the sea, truly there are signs in this for anyone who is steadfast and grateful,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="or He may cause them to founder because of people's misdeeds, He pardons many of them,"/>
		<aya index="35" text="those who dispute Our signs shall learn that they have no escape."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Whatever you have been given is only a temporary provision of this life, but that which is with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="who refrain from heinous sins and gross indecencies; who forgive when they are angry;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="who respond to their Lord and attend to their prayers; who conduct their affairs by mutual consultation and spend out of what We have provided for them;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="who, when they are attacked, defend themselves."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Let harm be requited by an equal harm. But whoever pardons and amends will find his reward with God. He does not love the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Those who defend themselves after they have been wronged cannot be held blameworthy,"/>
		<aya index="42" text="blame falls only on those who wrong men and transgress on this earth without justification, such will have a painful punishment,"/>
		<aya index="43" text="whoever is patient and forgiving, acts with great courage and resolution."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Anyone whom God lets go astray will thereafter have no protector whatsoever: you will see the wrongdoers, when they face the punishment, exclaiming, &quot;Is there no way back?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="You will see them exposed to the Fire, abject in humiliation, glancing furtively at it, while those who believed will say, &quot;The losers are those ones who have forfeited their souls and their people on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; Truly, the wrongdoers will remain in everlasting torment;"/>
		<aya index="46" text="they will have no allies to help them against God; there is no way [forward] for those whom God lets go astray."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Respond to your Lord before a Day arrives that will not be averted [against God's will]. You will not find any refuge from God on that Day, nor will you have [any opportunity] to deny your sins."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Now if they turn away, We have not sent you [O Prophet] as their keeper: your responsibility is only to convey the message. Man is such that when We let him taste Our mercy, he exults in it, but if an evil befalls him which is his own doing, he becomes utterly ungrateful."/>
		<aya index="49" text="God has control of the heavens and the earth; He creates whatever He will -- He grants female offspring to whoever He will, male to whoever He will,"/>
		<aya index="50" text="or both male and female, and He leaves whoever He will barren; He is all-knowing and all powerful."/>
		<aya index="51" text="It is not granted to any human being that God should speak to him other than by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending him a messenger, so that the messenger may reveal, by His command, whatsoever He will. Truly, He is exalted and wise."/>
		<aya index="52" text="We have thus revealed a Spirit to you [Prophet] by Our command: you knew neither the Scripture nor the faith, but We made it a light, guiding with it whoever We will of Our servants. You are indeed guiding to the straight path,"/>
		<aya index="53" text="the path of God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. Indeed all matters return eventually to God."/>
