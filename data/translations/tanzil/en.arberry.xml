	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif Lam Mim"/>
		<aya index="2" text="That is the Book, wherein is no doubt, a guidance to the godfearing"/>
		<aya index="3" text="who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer, and expend of that We have provided them;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="who believe in what has been sent down to thee and what has been sent down before thee, and have faith in the Hereafter;"/>
		<aya index="5" text="those are upon guidance from their Lord, those are the ones who prosper."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for the unbelievers, alike it is to them whether thou hast warned them or hast not warned them, they do not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And some men there are who say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day'; but they are not believers."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They would trick God and the believers, and only themselves they deceive, and they are not aware."/>
		<aya index="10" text="In their hearts is a sickness, and God has increased their sickness, and there awaits them a painful chastisement for that they have cried lies."/>
		<aya index="11" text="When it is said to them, 'Do not corruption in the land', they say, 'We are only ones that put things right.'"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Truly, they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware."/>
		<aya index="13" text="When it is said to them, 'Believe as the people believe', they say, 'Shall we believe, as fools believe?' Truly, they are the foolish ones, but they do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe'; but when they go privily to their Satans, they say, 'We are with you; we were only mocking.'"/>
		<aya index="15" text="God shall mock them, and shall lead them on blindly wandering in their insolence."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance, and their commerce has not profited them, and they are not right-guided."/>
		<aya index="17" text="The likeness of them is as the likeness of a man who kindled a fire, and when it lit all about him God took away their light, and left them in darkness unseeing"/>
		<aya index="18" text="deaf, dumb, blind -- so they shall not return;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="or as a cloudburst out of heaven in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning -- they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearful of death; and God encompasses the unbelievers;"/>
		<aya index="20" text="the lightning wellnigh snatches away their sight; whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it, and when the darkness is over them, they halt; had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Truly, God is powerful over everything."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O you men, serve your Lord Who created you, and those that were before you; haply so you will be godfearing;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="who assigned to you the earth for a couch, and heaven for an edifice, and sent down out of heaven water, wherewith He brought forth fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God wittingly."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if you are in doubt concerning that We have sent down on Our servant, then bring a sura like it, and call your witnesses, apart from God, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="And if you do not -- and you will not -- then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Give thou good tidings to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, that for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow; whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom they shall say, 'This is that wherewithal we were provided before'; that they shall be given in perfect semblance; and there for them shall be spouses purified; therein they shall dwell forever."/>
		<aya index="26" text="God is not ashamed to strike a similitude even of a gnat, or aught above it. As for the believers, they know it is the truth from their Lord; but as for unbelievers, they say, 'What did God desire by this for a similitude?' Thereby He leads many astray, and thereby He guides many; and thereby He leads none astray save the ungodly"/>
		<aya index="27" text="such as break the covenant of God after its solemn binding, and such as cut what God has commanded should be joined, and such as do corruption in the land -- they shall be the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How do you disbelieve in God, seeing you were dead and He gave you life, then He shall make you dead, then He shall give you life, then unto Him you shall be returned?"/>
		<aya index="29" text="It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, then He lifted Himself to heaven and levelled them seven heavens; and He has knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And when thy Lord said to the angels, 'I am setting in the earth a viceroy.' They said, 'What, wilt Thou set therein one who will do corruption there, and shed blood, while We proclaim Thy praise and call Thee Holy?' He said, 'Assuredly I know that you know not.'"/>
		<aya index="31" text="And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then He presented them unto the angels and said, 'Now tell Me the names of these, if you speak truly.'"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said, 'Glory be to Thee! We know not save what Thou hast taught us. Surely Thou art the All-knowing, the All-wise.'"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said, 'Adam, tell them their names.' And when he had told them their names He said, 'Did I not tell you I know the unseen things of the heavens and earth? And I know what things you reveal, and what you were hiding.'"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And when We said to the angels, 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis; he refused, and waxed proud, and so he became one of the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said, 'Adam, dwell thou, and thy wife, in the Garden, and eat thereof easefully where you desire; but draw not nigh this tree, lest you be evildoers.'"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Then Satan caused them to slip therefrom and brought them out of that they were in; and We said, 'Get you all down, each of you an enemy of each; and in the earth a sojourn shall be yours, and enjoyment for a time.'"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, and He turned towards him; truly He turns, and is All-compassionate."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said, 'Get you down out of it, all together; yet there shall come to you guidance from Me, and whosoever follows My guidance, no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow."/>
		<aya index="39" text="As for the unbelievers who cry lies to Our signs, those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.'"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I blessed you, and fulfil My covenant and I shall fulfil your covenant; and have awe of Me."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in that I have sent down, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And sell not My signs for a little price; and fear you Me."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And do not confound the truth with vanity, and do not conceal the truth wittingly."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and bow with those that bow."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Will you bid others to piety, and forget yourselves while you recite the Book? Do you not understand?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Seek you help in patience and prayer, for grievous it is, save to the humble"/>
		<aya index="46" text="who reckon that they shall meet their Lord and that unto Him they are returning."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I blessed you, and that I have preferred you above all beings;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="and beware of a day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction, and no intercession shall be accepted from it, nor any counterpoise be taken, neither shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="49" text="And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement, slaughtering your sons, and sparing your women; and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And when We divided for you the sea and delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's folk while you were beholding."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And when We appointed with Moses forty nights then you took to yourselves the Calf after him and you were evildoers;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="then We pardoned you after that, that haply you should be thankful."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when We gave to Moses the Book and the Salvation, that haply you should be guided."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And when Moses said to his people, 'My people, you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the Calf; now turn to your Creator and slay one another. That will be better for you in your Creator's sight, and He will turn to you; truly He turns, and is All-compassionate.'"/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when you said, 'Moses, we will not believe thee till we see God openly'; and the thunderbolt took you while you were beholding."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you up after you were dead, that haply you should be thankful."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And We outspread the cloud to overshadow you, and We sent down manna and quails upon you: 'Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you. And they worked no wrong upon Us, but themselves they wronged."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And when We said, 'Enter this township, and eat easefully of it wherever you will, and enter in at the gate, prostrating, and say, Unburdening; We will forgive you your transgressions, and increase the good-doers.'"/>
		<aya index="59" text="Then the evildoers substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them; so We sent down upon the evildoers wrath out of heaven for their ungodliness."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And when Moses sought water for his people, so We said, 'Strike with thy staff the rock'; and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains; all the people knew now their drinking-place. 'Eat and drink of God's providing, and mischief not in the earth, doing corruption.'"/>
		<aya index="61" text="And when you said, 'Moses, we will not endure one sort of food; pray to thy Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us of that the earth produces - green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions.' He said, 'Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt; you shall have there that you demanded.' And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them, and they were laden with the burden of God's anger; that, because they had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that, because they disobeyed, and were transgressors."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, and the Christians, and those Sabaeans, whoso believes in God and the Last Day, and works righteousness -- their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them; neither shall they sorrow."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And when We took compact with you, and raised above you the Mount: 'Take forcefully what We have given you, and remember what is in it; haply you shall be godfearing.'"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then you turned away thereafter, and but for the bounty and mercy of God towards you, you had been of the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And well you know there were those among you that transgressed the Sabbath, and We said to them, 'Be you apes, miserably slinking!'"/>
		<aya index="66" text="And We made it a punishment exemplary for all the former times and for the latter, and an admonition to such as are godfearing."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And when Moses said to his people, 'God commands you to sacrifice a cow.' They said, 'Dost thou take us in mockery?' He said, 'I take refuge with God, lest I should be one of the ignorant.'"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said, 'Pray to thy Lord for us, that He may make clear to us what she may be.' He said, 'He says she is a cow neither old, nor virgin, middling between the two; so do that you are bidden.'"/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said, 'Pray to thy Lord for us, that He make clear to us what her colour may be.' He said, 'He says she shall be a golden cow, bright her colour, gladdening the beholders.'"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said, 'Pray to thy Lord for us, that He make clear to us what she may be; cows are much alike to us; and, if God will, we shall then be guided.'"/>
		<aya index="71" text="He said, 'He says she shall be a cow not broken to plough the earth or to water the tillage, one kept secure, with no blemish on her.' They said, 'Now thou hast brought the truth'; and therefore they sacrificed her, a thing they had scarcely done."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And when you killed a living soul, and disputed thereon -- and God disclosed what you were hiding --"/>
		<aya index="73" text="so We said, 'Smite him with part of it'; even so God brings to life the dead, and He shows you His signs, that haply you may have understanding."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then your hearts became hardened thereafter and are like stones, or even yet harder; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing, and others split, so that water issues from them, and others crash down in the fear of God. And God is not heedless of the things you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Are you then so eager that they should believe you, seeing there is a party of them that heard God's word, and then tampered with it, and that after they had comprehended it, wittingly?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="And when they meet those who believe, they say 'We believe'; and when they go privily one to another, they say, 'Do you speak to them of what God has revealed to you, that they may thereby dispute with you before your Lord? Have you no understanding?'"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Know they not that God knows what they keep secret and what they publish?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And some there are of them that are common folk not knowing the Book, but only fancies and mere conjectures."/>
		<aya index="79" text="So woe to those who write the Book with their hands, then say, 'This is from God,' that they may sell it for a little price; so woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for their earnings."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And they say, 'The Fire shall not touch us save a number of days.' Say: 'Have you taken with God a covenant? God will not fail in His covenant; or say you things against God of which you know nothing?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Not so; whoso earns evil, and is encompassed by his transgression -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire; there they shall dwell forever."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- those are the inhabitants of Paradise; there they shall dwell forever.'"/>
		<aya index="83" text="And when We took compact with the Children of Israel: 'You shall not serve any save God; and to be good to parents, and the near kinsman, and to orphans, and to the needy; and speak good to men, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms.' Then you turned away, all but a few of you, swerving aside."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And when We took compact with you: 'You shall not shed your own blood, neither expel your own from your habitations'; then you confirmed it and yourselves bore witness."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of you from their habitations, conspiring against them in sin and enmity; and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them; yet their expulsion was forbidden you. What, do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part? What shall be the recompense of those of you who do that, but degradation in the present life, and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned unto the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of the things you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Those who have purchased the present life at the price of the world to come -- for them the chastisement shall not be lightened, neither shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And We gave to Moses the Book, and after him sent succeeding Messengers; and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear signs, and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit; and whensoever there came to you a Messenger with that your souls had not desire for, did you become arrogant, and some cry lies to, and some slay?"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say, 'Our hearts are uncircumcised.' Nay, but God has cursed them for their unbelief; little will they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="When there came to them a Book from God, confirming what was with them -- and they aforetimes prayed for victory over the unbelievers -- when there came to them that they recognized, they disbelieved in it; and the curse of God is on the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Evil is the thing they have sold themselves for, disbelieving in that which God sent down, grudging that God should send down of His bounty on whomsoever He will of His servants, and they were laden with anger upon anger; and for unbelievers awaits a humbling chastisement."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when they were told, 'Believe in that God has sent down,' they said, 'We believe in what was sent down on us'; and they disbelieve in what is beyond that, yet it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say: 'Why then were you slaying the Prophets of God in former time, if you were believers?'"/>
		<aya index="92" text="And Moses came to you with the clear signs, then you took to yourselves the Calf after him and you were evildoers."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And when We took compact with you, and raised over you the Mount: 'Take forcefully what We have given you and give ear.' They said, 'We hear, and rebel'; and they were made to drink the Calf in their hearts for their unbelief. Say: 'Evil is the thing your faith bids you to, if you are believers.'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say: 'If the Last Abode with God is yours exclusively, and not for other people, then long for death -- if you speak truly.'"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will never long for it, because of that their hands have forwarded; God knows the evildoers;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="and thou shalt find them the eagerest of men for life. And of the idolaters; there is one of them wishes if he might be spared a thousand years, yet his being spared alive shall not remove him from the chastisement. God sees the things they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say: 'Whosoever is an enemy to Gabriel -- he it was that brought it down upon thy heart by the leave of God, confirming what was before it, and for a guidance and good tidings to the believers."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Whosoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His Messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael - surely God is an enemy to the unbelievers.'"/>
		<aya index="99" text="And We have sent down unto thee signs, clear signs, and none disbelieves in them except the ungodly."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Why, whensoever they have made a covenant, does a party of them reject it? Nay, but the most of them are unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="101" text="When there has come to them a Messenger from God confirming what was with them, a party of them that were given the Book reject the Book of God behind their backs, as though they knew not,"/>
		<aya index="102" text="and they follow what the Satans recited over Solomon's kingdom. Solomon disbelieved not, but the Satans disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery, and that which was sent down upon Babylon's two angels, Harut and Marut; they taught not any man, without they said, 'We are but a temptation; do not disbelieve.' From them they learned how they might divide a man and his wife, yet they did not hurt any man thereby, save by the leave of God, and they learned what hurt them, and did not profit them, knowing well that whoso buys it shall have no share in the world to come; evil then was that they sold themselves for, if they had but known."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Yet had they believed, and been godfearing, a recompense from God had been better, if they had but known."/>
		<aya index="104" text="O believers, do not say, 'Observe us,' but say, 'Regard us'; and give ear; for unbelievers awaits a painful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Those unbelievers of the People of the Book and the idolaters wish not that any good should be sent down upon you from your Lord; but God singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding."/>
		<aya index="106" text="And for whatever verse We abrogate or cast into oblivion, We bring a better or the like of it; knowest thou not that God is powerful over everything?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Knowest thou not that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that you have none, apart from God, neither protector nor helper?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned in former time? Whoso exchanges belief for unbelief has surely strayed from the right way."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the People of the Book wish they might restore you as unbelievers, after you have believed, in the jealousy of their souls, after the truth has become clear to them; yet do you pardon and be forgiving, till God brings His command; truly God is powerful over everything."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And perform the prayer, and pay the alms; whatever good you shall forward to your souls' account, you shall find it with God; assuredly God sees the things you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say, 'None shall enter Paradise except that they be Jews or Christians.' Such are their fancies. Say: 'Produce your proof, if you speak truly.'"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Nay, but whosoever submits his will to God, being a good-doer, his wage is with his Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say, 'The Christians stand not on anything'; the Christians say, 'The Jews stand not on anything'; yet they recite the Book. So too the ignorant say the like of them. God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection touching their differences."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who does greater evil than he who bars God's places of worship, so that His Name be not rehearsed in them, and strives to destroy them? Such men might never enter them, save in fear; for them is degradation in the present world, and in the world to come a mighty chastisement."/>
		<aya index="115" text="To God belong the East and the West; whithersoever you turn, there is the Face of God; God is All-embracing, All-knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And they say, 'God has taken to Him a son. Glory be to Him! Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; all obey His will --"/>
		<aya index="117" text="the Creator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees a thing, He but says to it 'Be,' and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And they that know not say, 'Why does God not speak to us? Why does a sign not come to us?' So spoke those before them as these men say; their hearts are much alike. Yet We have made clear the signs unto a people who are sure"/>
		<aya index="119" text="We have sent thee with the truth, good tidings to bear, and warning. Thou shalt not be questioned touching the inhabitants of Hell."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Never will the Jews be satisfied with thee, neither the Christians, not till thou followest their religion. Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance.' If thou followest their caprices, after the knowledge that has come to thee, thou shalt have against God neither protector nor helper."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those to whom We have given the Book and who recite it with true recitation, they believe in it; and whoso disbelieves in it, they shall be the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I blessed you, and that I have preferred you above all beings;"/>
		<aya index="123" text="and beware a day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction, and no counterpoise shall be accepted from it, nor any intercession shall be profitable to it, neither shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, 'Behold, I make you a leader for the people.' Said he, 'And of my seed?' He said 'My covenant shall not reach the evildoers.'"/>
		<aya index="125" text="And when We appointed the House to be a place of visitation for the people, and a sanctuary, and: 'Take to yourselves Abraham's station for a place of prayer.' And We made covenant with Abraham and Ishmael: 'Purify My House for those that shall go about it and those that cleave to it, to those who bow and prostrate themselves.'"/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham said, 'My Lord, make this a land secure, and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in God and the Last Day.' He said, 'And whoso disbelieves, to him I shall give enjoyment a little, then I shall compel him to the chastisement of the Fire -- how evil a homecoming!'"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Abraham, and Ishmael with him, raised up the foundations of the House: 'Our Lord, receive this from us; Thou art the All-hearing, the All-knowing;"/>
		<aya index="128" text="and, our Lord, make us submissive to Thee, and of our seed a nation submissive to Thee; and show us our holy rites, and turn towards us; surely Thou turnest, and art All-compassionate;"/>
		<aya index="129" text="and, our Lord, do Thou send among them a Messenger, one of them, who shall recite to them Thy signs, and teach them the Book and the Wisdom, and purify them; Thou art the All-mighty, the All-wise.'"/>
		<aya index="130" text="Who therefore shrinks from the religion of Abraham, except he be foolish-minded? Indeed, We chose him in the present world, and in the world to come he shall be among the righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="When his Lord said to him, 'Surrender,' he said, 'I have surrendered me to the Lord of all Being.'"/>
		<aya index="132" text="And Abraham charged his sons with this and Jacob likewise: 'My sons, God has chosen for you the religion; see that you die not save in surrender.'"/>
		<aya index="133" text="Why, were you witnesses, when death came to Jacob? When he said to his sons, 'What will you serve after me?' They said, 'We will serve thy God and the God of thy fathers Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, One God; to Him we surrender.'"/>
		<aya index="134" text="That is a nation that has passed away; there awaits them that they have earned, and there awaits you that you have earned; you shall not be questioned concerning the things they did."/>
		<aya index="135" text="And they say, 'Be Jews or Christians and you shall be guided.' Say thou: 'Nay, rather the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith; he was no idolater.'"/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say you: 'We believe in God, and in that which has been sent down on us and sent down on Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes, and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the Prophets, of their Lord; we make no division between any of them, and to Him we surrender.'"/>
		<aya index="137" text="And if they believe in the like of that you believe in, then they are truly guided; but if they turn away, then they are clearly in schism; God will suffice you for them; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing;"/>
		<aya index="138" text="the baptism of God; and who is there that baptizes fairer than God? Him we are serving."/>
		<aya index="139" text="Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God, who is our Lord and your Lord? Our deeds belong to us, and to you belong your deeds; Him we serve sincerely."/>
		<aya index="140" text="Or do you say, &quot;Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes -- they were Jews, or they were Christians&quot;?' Say: 'Have you then greater knowledge, or God? And who does greater evil than he who conceals a testimony received from God? And God is not heedless of the things you do.'"/>
		<aya index="141" text="That is a nation that has passed away; there awaits them that they have earned, and there awaits you that you have earned; you shall not be questioned concerning the things they did."/>
		<aya index="142" text="The fools among the people will say, 'What has turned them from the direction they were facing in their prayers aforetime?' Say: &quot;To God belong the East and the West; He guides whomsoever He will to a straight path.'"/>
		<aya index="143" text="Thus We appointed you a midmost nation that you might be witnesses to the people, and that the Messenger might be a witness to you; and We did not appoint the direction thou wast facing, except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on his heels -- though it were a grave thing save for those whom God has guided; but God would never leave your faith to waste - truly, God is All-gentle with the people, All-compassionate."/>

		<aya index="282" text="O believers, when you contract a debt one upon another for a stated term, write it down, and let a writer write it down between you justly, and let not any writer refuse to write it down, as God has taught him; so let him write, and let the debtor dictate, and let him fear God his Lord and not diminish aught of it. And if the debtor be a fool, or weak, or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate justly. And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or if the two be not men, then one man and two women, such witnesses as you approve of, that if one of the two women errs the other will remind her; and let the witnesses not refuse, whenever they are summoned. And be not loth to write it down, whether it be small or great, with its term; that is more equitable in God's sight, more upright for testimony, and likelier that you will not be in doubt. Unless it be merchandise present that you give and take between you; then it shall be no fault in you if you do not write it down. And take witnesses when you are trafficking one with another. And let not either writer or witness be pressed; or if you do, that is ungodliness in you. And fear God; God teaches you, and God has knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="283" text="And if you are upon a journey, and you do not find a writer, then a pledge in hand. But if one of you trusts another, let him who is trusted deliver his trust, and let him fear God his Lord. And do not conceal the testimony; whoso conceals it, his heart is sinful; and God has knowledge of the things you do."/>

Our Lord, do Thou not burden us beyond what we have the strength to bear. And pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us; Thou art our Protector.

		<aya index="64" text="But they cried him lies; so We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We drowned those who cried lies to Our signs; assuredly they were a blind people."/>

		<aya index="68" text="I deliver to you the Messages of my Lord; I am your adviser sincere, faithful."/>

		<aya index="73" text="And to Thamood their brother Salih; he said, 'O my people, serve God! You have no god other than He; there has now come to you a clear sign from your Lord -- this is the She-camel of God, to be a sign for you. Leave her that she may eat in God's earth, and do not touch her with evil, lest you be seized by a painful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="74" text="And remember when He appointed you successors after Ad, and lodged you in the land, taking to yourselves castles of its plains, and hewing its mountains into houses. Remember God's bounties, and do not mischief in the earth, working corruption.'"/>

		<aya index="80" text="And Lot, when he said to his people, 'What, do you commit such indecency as never any being in all the world committed before you?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="See, you approach men lustfully instead of women; no, you are a people that do exceed.'"/>
		<aya index="82" text="And the only answer of his people was that they said, 'Expel them from your city; surely they are folk that keep themselves clean!'"/>
		<aya index="83" text="So We delivered him and his family, except his wife; she was one of those that tarried."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And We rained down upon them a rain; so behold thou, how was the end of the sinners!"/>
		<aya index="85" text="And to Midian their brother Shuaib; he said, 'O my people, serve God! You have no god other than He; there has now come to you a clear sign from your Lord. So fill up the measure and the balance, and diminish not the goods of the people; and do not corruption in the land, after it has been set right; that is better for you, if you are believers."/>
		<aya index="86" text="And do not sit in every path, threatening and barring from God's way those who believe in Him, desiring to make it crooked. And remember when you were few, and He multiplied you; and behold, how was the end of the workers of corruption."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And if there is a party of you who believe in the Message I have been sent with, and a party who believe not, be patient till God shall judge between us; He is the best of judges.'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="Said the Council of those of his people who waxed proud, 'We will surely expel thee, O Shuaib, and those who believe with thee, from our city, unless you return into our creed.' He said, 'What, even though we detest it?"/>
		<aya index="89" text="We should have forged against God a lie if we returned into your creed; after God delivered us from it. It is not for us to return into it, unless God our Lord so will. Our Lord embraces all things in His knowledge. In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, give true deliverance between us and our people; Thou art the best of deliverers.'"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Said the Council of those of his people who disbelieved, 'Now, if you follow Shuaib, assuredly in that case you will be losers.'"/>
		<aya index="91" text="So the earthquake seized them, and morning found them in their habitation fallen prostrate,"/>
		<aya index="92" text="those who cried lies to Shuaib, as if never they dwelt there; those who cried lies to Shuaib, they were the losers."/>
		<aya index="93" text="So he turned his back on them, and said, 'O my people, I have delivered to you the Messages of my Lord, and advised you sincerely; how should I grieve for a people of unbelievers?'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="We have sent no Prophet to any city but that We seized its people with misery and hardship, that haply they might be humble;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="then We gave them in the place of evil good, till they multiplied, and said, 'Hardship and happiness visited our fathers.' So We seized them suddenly, unawares."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Yet had the peoples of the cities believed and been godfearing, We would have opened upon them blessings from heaven and earth; but they cried lies, and so We seized them for what they earned."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Do the people of the cities feel secure Our might shall not come upon them at night while they are sleeping?"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Do the people of the cities feel secure Our might shall not come upon them in daylight while they are playing?"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Do they feel secure against God's devising? None feels secure against God's devising but the people of the lost."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Is it not a guidance to those who inherit the earth after those who inhabited it that, did We will, We would smite them because of their sins, sealing their hearts so they do not hear?"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Those cities We relate to thee tidings of; their Messengers came to them with the clear signs, but they were not the ones to believe in that they had cried lies before; so God seals the hearts of the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="102" text="We found no covenant in the most part of them; indeed, We found the most part of them ungodly."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Then We sent, after them, Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council, but they did them wrong; so behold thou, how was the end of the workers of corruption!"/>
		<aya index="104" text="Moses said, 'Pharaoh, I am a Messenger from the Lord of all Being,"/>
		<aya index="105" text="worthy to say nothing regarding God except the truth. I have brought a clear sign to you from your Lord; so send forth with me the Children of Israel.'"/>
		<aya index="106" text="Said he, 'If thou hast brought a sign, produce it, if thou speakest truly.'"/>
		<aya index="107" text="So he cast his staff; and behold, it was a serpent manifest."/>
		<aya index="108" text="And he drew forth his hand, and lo, it was white to the beholders."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Said the Council of the people of Pharaoh, 'Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer"/>
		<aya index="110" text="who desires to expel you from your land; what do you command?'"/>
		<aya index="111" text="They said, 'Put him and his brother off a while, and send among the cities musterers,"/>
		<aya index="112" text="to bring thee every cunning sorcerer.'"/>
		<aya index="113" text="And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, saying, 'We shall surely have a wage, if we should be the victors?'"/>
		<aya index="114" text="He said, 'Yes, indeed; and you shall be among the near-stationed.'"/>
		<aya index="115" text="They said, 'Moses, wilt thou cast, or shall we be the casters?'"/>
		<aya index="116" text="He said, 'You cast.' And when they cast they put a Spell upon the people's eyes, and called forth fear of them, and produced a mighty sorcery."/>
		<aya index="117" text="And We revealed to Moses: 'Cast thy staff!' And lo, it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention."/>
		<aya index="118" text="So the truth came to pass, and false was proved what they were doing."/>
		<aya index="119" text="So they were vanquished there, and they turned about, humbled."/>
		<aya index="120" text="And the sorcerers were cast down, bowing themselves."/>
		<aya index="121" text="They said, 'We believe in the Lord of all Being,"/>
		<aya index="122" text="the Lord of Moses and Aaron."/>
		<aya index="123" text="Said Pharaoh, 'You have believed in Him before I gave you leave. Surely this is a device you have devised in the city that you may expel its people from it. Now you shall know!"/>
		<aya index="124" text="I shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet, then I shall crucify you all together.'"/>
		<aya index="125" text="They said, 'Surely unto our Lord we are turning."/>
		<aya index="126" text="Thou takest vengeance upon us only because we have believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour out upon us patience, and gather us unto Thee surrendering.'"/>
		<aya index="127" text="Then said the Council of the people of Pharaoh, 'Wilt thou leave Moses and his people to work corruption in the land, and leave thee and thy gods?' Said he, 'We shall slaughter their sons and spare their women; surely we are triumphant over them!'"/>
		<aya index="128" text="Said Moses to his people, 'Pray for succour to God, and be patient; surely the earth is God's and He bequeaths it to whom He will among His servants. The issue ultimate is to the godfearing.'"/>
		<aya index="129" text="They said, 'We have been hurt before thou camest to us, and after thou camest to us.' He said, 'Perchance your Lord will destroy your enemy, and will make you successors in the land, so that He may behold how you shall do.'"/>
		<aya index="130" text="Then seized We Pharaoh's people with years of dearth, and scarcity of fruits, that haply they might remember."/>
		<aya index="131" text="So, when good came to them, they said, 'This belongs to us'; but if any evil smote them, they would augur ill by Moses and those with him. Why, surely their ill augury was with God; but the most of them knew not."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And they said, 'Whatsoever sign thou bringest to us, to cast a spell upon us, we will not believe thee.'"/>
		<aya index="133" text="So We let loose upon them the flood and the locusts, the lice and the frogs, the blood, distinct signs; but they waxed proud and were a sinful people."/>
		<aya index="134" text="And when the wrath fell upon them, they said, 'Moses, pray to thy Lord for us by the covenant He has made with thee. If thou removest from us the wrath, surely we will believe thee, and send forth with thee the Children of Israel.'"/>
		<aya index="135" text="But when We removed from them the wrath unto a term that they should come to, lo, they broke their troth."/>
		<aya index="136" text="So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea, for that they cried lies to Our signs and heeded them not."/>
		<aya index="137" text="And We bequeathed upon the people that were abased all the east and the west of the land We had blessed; and perfectly was fulfilled the most fair word of thy Lord upon the Children of Israel, for that they endured patiently; and We destroyed utterly the works of Pharaoh and his people, and what they had been building."/>
		<aya index="138" text="And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea, and they came upon a people cleaving to idols they had. They said, 'Moses, make for us a god, as they have gods.' Said he, 'You are surely a people who are ignorant."/>
		<aya index="139" text="Surely this they are engaged upon shall be shattered, and void is what they have been doing.'"/>
		<aya index="140" text="He said, 'What, shall I seek a god for you other than God, who has preferred you above all beings?'"/>
		<aya index="141" text="And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement, slaying your sons, and sparing your women -- and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="142" text="And We appointed with Moses thirty nights and We completed them with ten, so the appointed time of his Lord was forty nights; and Moses said to his brother Aaron, 'Be my successor among my people, and put things right, and do not follow the way of the workers of corruption.'"/>
		<aya index="143" text="And when Moses came to Our appointed time and his Lord spoke with him, he said, 'Oh my Lord, show me, that I may behold Thee!' Said He, 'Thou shalt not see Me; but behold the mountain -- if it stays fast in its place, then thou shalt see Me.' And when his Lord revealed Him to the mountain He made it crumble to dust; and Moses fell down swooning. So when he awoke, he said, 'Glory be to Thee! I repent to Thee; I am the first of the believers.'"/>
		<aya index="144" text="Said He, 'Moses, I have chosen thee above all men for My Messages and My Utterance; take what I have given thee, and be of the thankful.'"/>
		<aya index="145" text="And We wrote for him on the Tablets of everything an admonition, and a distinguishing of everything: 'So take it forcefully, and command thy people to take the fairest of it. I shall show you the habitation of the ungodly."/>
		<aya index="146" text="I shall turn from My signs those who wax proud in the earth unjustly; though they see every sign, they will not believe in it, and though they see the way of rectitude they will not take it for a way, and though they see the way of error, they will take it for a way. That, because they have cried lies to Our signs and heeded them not.'"/>
		<aya index="147" text="Those who cry lies to Our signs, and the encounter in the world to come -- their works have failed; shall they be recompensed, except according to the things they have done?"/>
		<aya index="148" text="And the people of Moses took to them, after him, of their ornaments a Calf -- a mere body that lowed. Did they not see it spoke not to them, neither guided them upon any way? Yet they took it to them, and were evildoers."/>
		<aya index="149" text="And when they smote their hands, and saw that they had gone astray, they said, 'If our Lord has not mercy on us, and forgives us not, surely we shall be of the lost.'"/>
		<aya index="150" text="And when Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful, he said, 'Evilly have you done in my place, after me; what, have you outstripped your Lord's commandment?' And he cast down the Tablets, and laid hold of his brother's head, dragging him to him. He said, 'Son of my mother, surely the people have abased me, and well nigh slain me. Make not my enemies to gloat over me, and put me not among the people of the evildoers."/>

		<aya index="73" text="But they cried him lies; so We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We appointed them as viceroys, and We drowned those who cried lies to Our signs; then behold how was the end of them that were warned!"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then We sent forth, after him, Messengers to their people, and they brought them the clear signs; but they were not men to believe in that they had cried lies to before. So We seal the hearts of the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Then We sent forth, after them, Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his Council with Our signs, but they waxed proud, and were a sinful people."/>
		<aya index="76" text="So, when the truth came to them from Us, they said, 'Surely this is a manifest sorcery.'"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Moses said, 'What, do you say this to the truth, when it has come to you? Is this a sorcery? But sorcerers do not prosper.'"/>

		<aya index="80" text="Then, when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, 'Cast you down what you will cast.'"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Then, when they had cast, Moses said, 'What you have brought is sorcery; God will assuredly bring it to naught. God sets not right the work of those who do corruption."/>
		<aya index="82" text="God verifies the truth by His words, though sinners be averse.'"/>
		<aya index="83" text="So none believed in Moses, save a seed of his people, for fear of Pharaoh and their Council, that they would persecute them; and Pharaoh was high in the land, and he was one of the prodigals."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Moses said, 'O my people, if you believe in God, in Him put your trust, if you have surrendered.'"/>
		<aya index="85" text="They said, 'In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, make us not a temptation to the people of the evildoers,"/>
		<aya index="86" text="and deliver us by Thy mercy from the people of the unbelievers.'"/>
		<aya index="87" text="And We revealed to Moses and his brother, 'Take you, for your people, in Egypt certain houses; and make your houses a direction for men to pray to; and perform the prayer; and do thou give good tidings to the believers.'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="Moses said, 'Our Lord, Thou hast given to Pharaoh and his Council adornment and possessions in this present life. Our Lord, let them go astray from Thy way; Our Lord, obliterate their possessions, and harden their hearts so that they do not believe, till they see the painful chastisement.'"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He said, 'Your prayer is answered; so go you straight, and follow not the way of those that know not.'"/>
		<aya index="90" text="And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts followed them insolently and impetuously till, when the drowning overtook him, he said, 'I believe that there is no god but He in whom the Children of Israel believe; I am of those that surrender.'"/>
		<aya index="91" text="'Now? And before thou didst rebel, being of those that did corruption."/>
		<aya index="92" text="So today We shall deliver thee with thy body, that thou mayest be a sign to those after thee. Surely many men are heedless of Our signs.'"/>
		<aya index="93" text="And We settled the Children of Israel in a sure settlement, and We provided them with good things; so they differed not until the knowledge came to them. Surely thy Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection touching their differences."/>
		<aya index="94" text="So, if thou art in doubt regarding what We have sent down to thee, ask those who recite the Book before thee. The truth has come to thee from thy Lord; so be not of the doubters,"/>
		<aya index="95" text="nor be of those who cry lies to God's signs so as to be of the losers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Those against whom thy Lord's word is realized will not believe,"/>
		<aya index="97" text="though every sign come to them, till they see the painful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Why was there never a city that believed, and its belief profited it? -- Except the people of Jonah; when they believed, We removed from them the chastisement of degradation in this present life, and We gave unto them enjoyment for a time."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And if thy Lord had willed, whoever is in the earth would have believed, all of them, all together. Wouldst thou then constrain the people, until they are believers?"/>
		<aya index="100" text="It is not for any soul to believe save by the leave of God; and He lays abomination upon those who have no understanding."/>
		<aya index="101" text="Say: 'Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth!' But neither signs nor warnings avail a people who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="102" text="So do they watch and wait for aught but the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say: 'Then watch and wait; I shall be with you watching and waiting.'"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Then We shall deliver Our Messengers and the believers. Even so, as is Our bounden duty, We shall deliver the believers."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Say: 'O men, if you are in doubt regarding my religion, I serve not those you serve apart from God, but I serve God, who will gather you to Him, and I am commanded to be of the believers, and:"/>
		<aya index="105" text="&quot;Set thy face to the religion, a man of pure faith, and be thou not of the idolaters;"/>
		<aya index="106" text="and do not call, apart from God, on that which neither profits nor hurts thee, for if thou dost, then thou wilt surely be of the evildoers."/>
		<aya index="107" text="And if God visits thee with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He desires any good for thee, none can repel His bounty; He causes it to fall upon whomsoever He will of His servants.&quot; He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.'"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Say: 'O men, the truth has come to you from your Lord. Whosoever is guided is guided only to his own gain, and whosoever goes astray, it is only to his own loss. I am not a guardian over you."/>
		<aya index="109" text="And follow thou what is revealed to thee; and be thou patient until God shall judge; and He is the best of judges."/>

		<aya index="85" text="O my people, fill up the measure and the balance justly, and do not diminish the goods of the people, and do not mischief in the land, working corruption."/>
		<aya index="86" text="God's remainder is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a guardian over you."/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said, 'Shuaib, does thy prayer command thee that we should leave that our fathers served, or to do as we will with our goods? Thou art the clement one, the right-minded.'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="He said, 'O my people, what think you? If I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord, and He has provided me with fair provision from Him -- and I desire not to come behind you, betaking me to that I forbid you; I desire only to set things right, so far as I am able. My succour is only with God; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn, penitent."/>
		<aya index="89" text="O my people, let not the breach with me move you, so that there smite you the like of what smote the people of Noah, or the people of Hood, or the people of Salih; and the people of Lot are not far away from you."/>
		<aya index="90" text="And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him; surely my Lord is All-compassionate, All-loving.'"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said, 'Shuaib, we do not understand much of what thou sayest. Truly we see thee weak among us; but for thy tribe we would have stoned thee; for thou art not strong against us."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said, 'O my people, is my tribe stronger against you than God? And Him -- have you taken Him as something to be thrust behind you? My Lord encompasses the things you do."/>
		<aya index="93" text="O my people, act according to your station; I am acting; and certainly you will know to whom will come the chastisement degrading him, and who is a liar. And be upon the watch; I shall be with you, watching.'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when Our command came, We delivered Shuaib and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and the evildoers were seized by the Cry, and morning found them in their habitations fallen prostrate"/>
		<aya index="95" text="as if they had never dwelt there: 'So away with Midian, even as Thamood was done away!'"/>
		<aya index="96" text="And We sent Moses with Our signs, and a manifest authority,"/>
		<aya index="97" text="to Pharaoh and his Council; but they followed Pharaoh's command, and Pharaoh's command was not right-minded."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He shall go before his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will have led them down to the Fire-evil the watering-place to be led down to!"/>
		<aya index="99" text="And there was sent following after them in this world a curse, and upon the Day of Resurrection -- evil the offering to be offered!"/>
		<aya index="100" text="That is of the tidings of the cities We relate to thee; some of them are standing and some stubble."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves; their gods availed them not that they called upon, apart from God, anything, when the command of thy Lord came; and they increased them not, save in destruction."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Such is the seizing of thy Lord, when He seizes the cities that are evildoing; surely His seizing is painful, terrible."/>

		<aya index="105" text="the day it comes, no soul shall speak save by His leave; some of them shall be wretched and some happy."/>

		<aya index="109" text="So be thou not in doubt concerning what these men serve; they serve only as their fathers served before; and We shall surely pay them in full their portion undiminished."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And We gave Moses the Book; and there was difference regarding it, and but for a word that preceded from thy Lord, it had been decided between them; and they are in doubt of it disquieting."/>
		<aya index="111" text="Surely each one of them -- thy Lord will pay them in full for their works; He is aware of the things they do."/>
		<aya index="112" text="So go thou straight, as thou hast been commanded, and whoso repents with thee; and be you not insolent; surely He sees the things you do."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And lean not on the evildoers, so that the Fire touches you -- you have no protectors apart from God -- and then you will not be helped."/>

		<aya index="116" text="Or if there had been, of the generations before you, men of a remainder forbidding corruption in the earth -- except a few of those whom We delivered of them; but the evildoers followed the ease they were given to exult in and became sinners."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Yet thy Lord would never destroy the cities unjustly, while as yet their people were putting things right."/>

		<aya index="3" text="We will relate to thee the fairest of stories in that We have revealed to thee this Koran, though before it thou wast one of the heedless."/>
		<aya index="4" text="When Joseph said to his father, 'Father, I saw eleven stars, and the sun and the moon; I saw them bowing down before me.'"/>
		<aya index="5" text="He said, 'O my son, relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they devise against thee some guile. Surely Satan is to man a manifest enemy."/>
		<aya index="6" text="So will thy Lord choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of tales, and perfect His blessing upon thee and upon the House of Jacob, as He perfected it formerly on thy fathers Abraham and Isaac; surely thy Lord is All-knowing, All-wise.'"/>
		<aya index="7" text="(In Joseph and his brethren were signs for those who ask questions.)"/>
		<aya index="8" text="When they said, 'Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we, though we are a band. Surely our father is in manifest error."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Kill you Joseph, or cast him forth into some land, that your father's face may be free for you, and thereafter you may be a righteous people.'"/>
		<aya index="10" text="One of them said, 'No, kill not Joseph, but cast him into the bottom of the pit and some traveller will pick him out, if you do aught.'"/>
		<aya index="11" text="They said, 'Father, what ails thee, that thou trustest us not with Joseph? Surely we are his sincere well-wishers."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Send him forth with us tomorrow, to frolic and play; surely we shall be watching over him.'"/>
		<aya index="13" text="He said, 'It grieves me that you should go with him, and I fear the wolf may eat him, while you are heedless of him.'"/>
		<aya index="14" text="They said, 'If the wolf eats him, and we a band, then are we losers!'"/>
		<aya index="15" text="So when they went with him, and agreed to put him in the bottom of the well, and We revealed to him, 'Thou shalt tell them of this their doing when they are unaware.'"/>
		<aya index="16" text="And they came to their father in the evening, and they were weeping."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They said, 'Father, we went running races, and left Joseph behind with our things; so the wolf ate him. But thou wouldst never believe us, though we spoke truly.'"/>
		<aya index="18" text="And they brought his shirt with false blood on it. He said, 'No; but your spirits tempted you to do somewhat. But come, sweet patience! And God's succour is ever there to seek against that you describe.'"/>
		<aya index="19" text="Then came travellers, and they sent one of them, a water-drawer, who let down his bucket. 'Good news!' he said. 'Here is a young man.' So they hid him as merchandise; but God knew what they were doing."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Then they sold him for a paltry price, a handful of counted dirhams; for they set small store by him."/>
		<aya index="21" text="He that bought him, being of Egypt, said to his wife, 'Give him goodly lodging, and it may be that he will profit us, or we may take him for our own son.' So We established Joseph in the land, and that We might teach him the interpretation of tales. God prevails in His purpose, but most men know not."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he was fully grown, We gave him judgment and knowledge. Even so We recompense the good-doers."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Now the woman in whose house he was solicited him, and closed the doors on them. 'Come,' she said, 'take me!' 'God be my refuge,' he said. 'Surely my lord has given me a goodly lodging. Surely the evildoers do not prosper."/>
		<aya index="24" text="For she desired him; and he would have taken her, but that he saw the proof of his Lord. So was it, that We might turn away from him evil and abomination; he was one of Our devoted servants."/>
		<aya index="25" text="They raced to the door; and she tore his shirt from behind. They encountered her master by the door. She said, 'What is the recompense of him who purposes evil against thy folk, but that he should be imprisoned, or a painful chastisement?'"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Said he, 'It was she that solicited me'; and a witness of her folk bore witness, 'If his shirt has been torn from before then she has spoken truly, and he is one of the liars;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="but if it be that his shirt has been torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is one of the truthful.'"/>
		<aya index="28" text="When he saw his shirt was torn from behind he said, 'This is of your women's guile; surely your guile is great."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Joseph, turn away from this; and thou, woman, ask forgiveness of thy crime; surely thou art one of the sinners.'"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Certain women that were in the city said, 'The Governor's wife has been soliciting her page; he smote her heart with love; we see her in manifest error."/>
		<aya index="31" text="When she heard their sly whispers, she sent to them, and made ready for them a repast, then she gave to each one of them a knife. 'Come forth, attend to them,' she said. And when they saw him, they so admired him that they cut their hands, saying, 'God save us! This is no mortal; he is no other but a noble angel.'"/>
		<aya index="32" text="'So now you see, she said. 'This is he you blamed me for. Yes, I solicited him, but he abstained. Yet if he will not do what I command him, he shall be imprisoned, and be one of the humbled.'"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said, 'My Lord, prison is dearer to me than that they call me to; yet if Thou turnest not from me their guile, then I shall yearn towards them, and so become one of the ignorant.'"/>
		<aya index="34" text="So his Lord answered him, and He turned away from him their guile; surely He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Then it seemed good to them, after they had seen the signs, that they should imprison him for a while."/>
		<aya index="36" text="And there entered the prison with him two youths. Said one of them, 'I dreamed that I was pressing grapes. Said the other, 'I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread, that birds were eating of. Tell us its interpretation; we see that thou art of the good-doers.'"/>
		<aya index="37" text="He said, 'No food shall come to you for your sustenance, but ere it comes to you I shall tell you its interpretation. That I shall tell you is of what God has taught me. I have forsaken the creed of a people who believe not in God and who moreover are unbelievers in the world to come."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And I have followed the creed of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Not ours is it to associate aught with God. That is of God's bounty to us, and to men; but most men are not thankful."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Say, which is better, my fellow-prisoners -- many gods at variance, or God the One, the Omnipotent?"/>
		<aya index="40" text="That which you serve, apart from Him, is nothing but names yourselves have named, you and your fathers; God has sent down no authority touching them. Judgment belongs only to God; He has commanded that you shall not serve any but Him. That is the right religion; but most men know not."/>
		<aya index="41" text="Fellow-prisoners, as for one of you, he shall pour wine for his lord; as for the other, he shall be crucified, and birds will eat of his head. The matter is decided whereon you enquire.'"/>
		<aya index="42" text="Then he said to the one he deemed should be saved of the two, 'Mention me in thy lord's presence.' But Satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master, so that he continued in the prison for certain years."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And the king said, 'I saw in a dream seven fat kine, and seven lean ones devouring them; likewise seven green ears of corn, and seven withered. My counsellors, pronounce to me upon my dream, if you are expounders of dreams.'"/>
		<aya index="44" text="'A hotchpotch of nightmares!' they said. 'We know nothing of the interpretation of nightmares.'"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Then said the one who had been delivered, remembering after a time, 'I will myself tell you its interpretation; so send me forth.'"/>
		<aya index="46" text="'Joseph, thou true man, pronounce to us regarding seven fat kine, that seven lean ones were devouring, seven green ears of corn, and seven withered; haply I shall return to the men, haply they will know.'"/>
		<aya index="47" text="He said, 'You shall sow seven years after your wont; what you have harvested leave in the ear, excepting a little whereof you eat."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Then thereafter there shall come upon you seven hard years, that shall devour what you have laid up for them, all but a little you keep in store."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Then thereafter there shall come a year wherein the people will be succoured and press in season."/>
		<aya index="50" text="The king said, 'Bring him to me!' And when the messenger came to him, he said, 'Return unto thy lord, and ask of him, &quot;What of the women who cut their hands?&quot; Surely my Lord has knowledge of their guile.'"/>
		<aya index="51" text="'What was your business, women,' he said, 'when you solicited Joseph?' 'God save us!' they said. 'We know no evil against him.' The Governor's wife said, 'Now the truth is at last discovered; I solicited him; he is a truthful man."/>
		<aya index="52" text="'That, so that he may know I betrayed him not secretly, and that God guides not the guile of the treacherous."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Yet I claim not that my soul was innocent -- surely the soul of man incites to evil -- except inasmuch as my Lord had mercy; truly my Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'"/>
		<aya index="54" text="The king said, 'Bring him to me! I would attach him to my person.' Then, when he had spoken with him, he said, 'Today thou art established firmly in our favour and in our trust.'"/>
		<aya index="55" text="He said, 'Set me over the land's storehouses; I am a knowing guardian.'"/>
		<aya index="56" text="So We established Joseph in the land, to make his dwelling there wherever he would. We visit with Our mercy whomsoever We will, and We leave not to waste the wage of the good-doers."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Yet is the wage of the world to come better for those who believe, and are godfearing."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And the brethren of Joseph came, and entered unto him, and he knew them, but they knew him not."/>
		<aya index="59" text="When he had equipped them with their equipment be said, 'Bring me a certain brother of yours from your father. Do you not see that I fill up the measure, and am the best of hosts?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="But if you bring him not to me, there shall be no measure for you with me, neither shall you come nigh me.'"/>
		<aya index="61" text="They said, 'We will solicit him of our father; that we will do.'"/>
		<aya index="62" text="He said to his pages, 'Put their merchandise in their saddlebags; haply they will recognize it when they have turned to their people; haply they will return."/>
		<aya index="63" text="So, when they had returned to their father, they said, 'Father, the measure was denied to us; so send with us our brother, that we may obtain the measure; surely we shall be watching over him.'"/>
		<aya index="64" text="He said, 'And shall I entrust him to you otherwise than as I entrusted before his brother to you? Why, God is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful.'"/>
		<aya index="65" text="And when they opened their things, they found their merchandise, restored to them. 'Father,' they said, 'what more should we desire? See, our merchandise here is restored to us. We shall get provision for our family, and we shall be watching over our brother; we shall obtain an extra camel's load -- that is an easy measure."/>
		<aya index="66" text="He said, 'Never will I send him with you until you bring me a solemn pledge by God that you will surely bring him back to me unless it be that you are encompassed.' When they had brought him their solemn pledge he said, 'God shall be Guardian over what we say.'"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He also said, 'O my sons, enter not by one door; enter by separate doors. Yet I cannot avail you anything against God; judgment belongs not to any but God. In Him I have put my trust; and in Him let all put their trust who put their trust.'"/>
		<aya index="68" text="And when they entered after the manner their father commanded them, it availed them nothing against God; but it was a need in Jacob's soul that he so satisfied. Verily he was possessed of a knowledge for that We had taught him; but most men know not."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And when they entered unto Joseph, he said, taking his brother into his arms, 'I am thy brother; so do not despair of that they have done.'"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Then, when he had equipped them with their equipment, he put his drinking-cup into the saddlebag of his brother. Then a herald proclaimed, 'Ho, cameleers, you are robbers!'"/>
		<aya index="71" text="They said, turning to them, 'What is it that you are missing?'"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They said, 'We are missing the king's goblet. Whoever brings it shall receive a camel's load; that I guarantee.'"/>
		<aya index="73" text="'By God,' they said, 'you know well that we came not to work corruption in the land. We are not robbers.'"/>
		<aya index="74" text="They said, 'And what shall be its recompense if you are liars?'"/>
		<aya index="75" text="They said, 'This shall be its recompense -- in whoever's saddlebag the goblet is found, he shall be its recompense. So we recompense the evildoers.'"/>
		<aya index="76" text="So he made beginning with their sacks, before his brother's sack, then he pulled it out of his brother's sack. So We contrived for Joseph's sake; he could not have taken his brother, according to the king's doom, except that God willed. Whomsoever We will, We raise in rank; over every man of knowledge is One who knows."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They said, 'If he is a thief, a brother of his was a thief before.' But Joseph secreted it in his soul and disclosed it not to them, saying, 'You are in a worse case; God knows very well what you are describing.'"/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said, 'Mighty prince, he has a father, aged and great with years; so take one of us in his place; we see that thou art one of the good-doers.'"/>
		<aya index="79" text="He said, 'God forbid that we should take any other but him in whose possession we found the goods; for if we did so, we would be evildoers.'"/>
		<aya index="80" text="When they despaired of moving him, they conferred privily apart. Said the eldest of them, 'Do you not know how your father has taken a solemn pledge from you by God, and aforetime you failed regarding Joseph? Never will I quit this land, until my father gives me leave, or God judges in my favour; He is the best of judges."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Return you all to your father, and say, &quot;Father, thy son stole; we do not testify except that we know; we were no guardians of the Unseen."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Enquire of the city wherein we were, and the caravan in which we approached; surely we are truthful men&quot;.'"/>
		<aya index="83" text="'No!' he said 'But your spirits tempted you to do somewhat. But come, sweet patience! Haply God will bring them all to me; He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.'"/>
		<aya index="84" text="And he turned away from them, and said, 'Ah, woe is me for Joseph!' And his eyes turned white because of the sorrow that he choked within him."/>
		<aya index="85" text="'By God,' they said, 'thou wilt never cease mentioning Joseph till thou art consumed, or among the perishing.'"/>
		<aya index="86" text="He said, 'I make complaint of my anguish and my sorrow unto God; I know from God that you know not."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Depart, my sons, and search out tidings of Joseph and his brother. Do not despair of God's comfort; of God's comfort no man despairs, excepting the people of the unbelievers.'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="So, when they entered unto him, they said, 'O mighty prince, affliction has visited us and our people. We come with merchandise of scant worth. Fill up to us the measure, and be charitable to us; surely God recompenses the charitable.'"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He said, 'Are you aware of what you did with Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?'"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They said, 'Why, art thou indeed Joseph?' 'I am Joseph,' he said. 'This is my brother. God has indeed been gracious unto us. Whosoever fears God, and is patient -- surely God leaves not to waste the wage of the good-doers."/>
		<aya index="91" text="'By God,' they said, 'God has indeed preferred thee above us, and certainly we have been sinful.'"/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said, 'No reproach this day shall be on you; God will forgive you; He is the most merciful of the merciful."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Go, take this shirt, and do you cast it on my father's face, and he shall recover his sight; then bring me your family all together.'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="So, when the caravan set forth, their father said, 'Surely I perceive Joseph's scent, unless you think me doting.'"/>
		<aya index="95" text="They said, 'By God, thou art certainly in thy ancient error."/>
		<aya index="96" text="But when the bearer of good tidings came to him, and laid it on his face, forthwith he saw once again. He said, 'Did I not tell you I know from God that you know not?'"/>
		<aya index="97" text="They said, 'Our father, ask forgiveness of our crimes for us; for certainly we have been sinful.'"/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said, 'Assuredly I will ask my Lord to forgive you; He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.'"/>
		<aya index="99" text="So, when they entered unto Joseph, he took his father and mother into his arms saying, 'Enter you into Egypt, if God will, in security.'"/>
		<aya index="100" text="And he lifted his father and mother upon the throne; and the others fell down prostrate before him. 'See, father,' he said, 'this is the interpretation of my vision of long ago; my Lord has made it true. He was good to me when He brought me forth from the prison, and again when He brought you out of the desert, after that Satan set at variance me and my brethren. My Lord is gentle to what He will; He is the All-knowing, the All-wise."/>
		<aya index="101" text="O my Lord, Thou hast given me to rule, and Thou hast taught me the interpretation of tales. O Thou, the Originator of the heavens and earth, Thou art my Protector in this world and the next. O receive me to Thee in true submission, and join me with the righteous.'"/>
		<aya index="102" text="That is of the tidings of the Unseen that We reveal to thee; thou wast not with them when they agreed upon their plan, devising."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Yet, be thou ever so eager, the most part of men believe not."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Thou askest of them no wage for it; it is nothing but a reminder unto all beings."/>
		<aya index="105" text="How many a sign there is in the heavens and in the earth that they pass by, turning away from it!"/>
		<aya index="106" text="And the most part of them believe not in God, but they associate other gods with Him."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do they feel secure that there shall come upon them no enveloping of the chastisement of God, or that the Hour shall not come upon them suddenly when they are unaware?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Say: 'This is my way. I call to God with sure knowledge, I and whoever follows after me. To God be glory! And I am not among the idolaters.'"/>
		<aya index="109" text="We sent not forth any before thee, but men We revealed to of the people living in the cities. Have they not journeyed in the land? Have they not beheld how was the end of those before them?. Surely the abode of the world to come is better for those that are godfearing. What, do you not understand?"/>
		<aya index="110" text="Till, when the Messengers despaired, deeming they were counted liars, Our help came to them and whosoever We willed was delivered. Our might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners."/>
		<aya index="111" text="In their stories is surely a lesson to men possessed of minds; it is not a tale forged, but a confirmation of what is before it, and a distinguishing of every thing, and a guidance, and a mercy to a people who believe."/>

		<aya index="8" text="He said, 'O my Lord, how shall I have a son, seeing my wife is barren, and I have attained to the declining of old age?'"/>
		<aya index="9" text="Said He, 'So it shall be; thy Lord says, &quot;Easy is that for Me, seeing that I created thee aforetime, when thou wast nothing.&quot;'"/>

		<aya index="11" text="So he came forth unto his people from the Sanctuary, then he made signal to them, 'Give you glory at dawn and evening.'"/>
		<aya index="12" text="'O John, take the Book forcefully'; and We gave him judgment, yet a little child,"/>
		<aya index="13" text="and a tenderness from Us, and purity; and he was godfearing,"/>

		<aya index="15" text="'Peace be upon him, the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he is raised up alive!'"/>

		<aya index="18" text="She said, 'I take refuge in the All-merciful from thee!"/>
		<aya index="19" text="If thou fearest God... He said, 'I am but a messenger come from thy Lord, to give thee a boy most pure."/>
		<aya index="20" text="She said, 'How shall I have a son whom no mortal has touched, neither have I been unchaste?'"/>
		<aya index="21" text="He said, 'Even so thy Lord has said: &quot;Easy is that for Me; and that We may appoint him a sign unto men and a mercy from Us; it is a thing decreed.&quot;'"/>
		<aya index="22" text="So she conceived him, and withdrew with him to a distant place."/>

		<aya index="33" text="Peace be upon me, the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised up alive!'"/>
		<aya index="34" text="That is Jesus, son of Mary, in word of truth, concerning which they are doubting."/>
		<aya index="35" text="It is not for God to take a son unto Him. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a thing, He but says to it 'Be,' and it is."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Surely God is my Lord, and your Lord; So serve you Him. This is a straight path."/>
		<aya index="37" text="But the parties have fallen into variance among themselves; then woe to those who disbelieve for the scene of a dreadful day."/>

		<aya index="40" text="Surely We shall inherit the earth and all that are upon it, and unto Us they shall be returned."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And mention in the Book Abraham; surely he was a true man, a Prophet."/>
		<aya index="42" text="When he said to his father, 'Father, why worshippest thou that which neither hears nor sees, nor avails thee anything?"/>

		<aya index="48" text="Now I will go apart from you and that you call upon, apart from God; I will call upon my Lord, and haply I shall not be, in calling upon my Lord, unprosperous."/>
		<aya index="49" text="So, when he went apart from them and that they were serving, apart from God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each We made a Prophet;"/>

		<aya index="52" text="We called to him from the right side Of the Mount, and We brought him near in communion."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And We gave him his brother Aaron, of Our mercy, a Prophet."/>

		<aya index="4" text="Now Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land and had divided its inhabitants into sects, abasing one party of them, slaughtering their sons, and sparing their women; for he was of the workers of corruption."/>
		<aya index="5" text="Yet We desired to be gracious to those that were abased in the land, and to make them leaders, and to make them the inheritors,"/>

		<aya index="7" text="So We revealed to Moses' mother, 'Suckle him, then, when thou fearest for him, cast him into the sea, and do not fear, neither sorrow, for We shall return him to thee, and shall appoint him one of the Envoys.'"/>
		<aya index="8" text="So then the folk of Pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy and a sorrow to them; certainly Pharaoh and Haman, and their hosts, were of the sinners."/>

		<aya index="10" text="On the morrow the heart of Moses&quot; mother became empty, and she wellnigh disclosed him had We not strengthened her heart, that she might be among the believers;"/>
		<aya index="11" text="and she said to his sister, 'Follow him,' and she perceived him from afar, even while they were not aware."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Now We had forbidden to him aforetime to be suckled by any foster-mother; therefore she said, 'Shall I direct you to the people of a household who will take charge of him for you and look after him?'"/>
		<aya index="13" text="So We returned him to his mother, that she might be comforted and not sorrow, and that she might know that the promise of God is true; but most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when he was fully grown and in the perfection of his strength, We gave him judgment and knowledge; even so do We recompense the good-doers."/>
		<aya index="15" text="And he entered the city, at a time when its people were unheeding, and found there two men fighting; the one was of his own party, and the other was of his enemies. Then the one that was of his party cried to him to aid him against the other that was of his enemies; so Moses struck him, and despatched him, and said, 'This is of Satan's doing; he is surely an enemy misleading, manifest.'"/>
		<aya index="16" text="He said, 'My Lord, I have wronged myself. Forgive me!' So God forgave him, for He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate."/>
		<aya index="17" text="He said, 'My Lord, forasmuch as Thou hast blessed me, I will never be a partisan of the sinners.'"/>
		<aya index="18" text="Now in the morning he was in the city, fearful and vigilant; and behold, the man who had sought his, succour on the day before cried out to him again. Moses said to him, 'Clearly thou art, a quarreller.'"/>
		<aya index="19" text="But when he would have assaulted the man who was an enemy to them both, the man said, 'Moses, dost thou' desire to slay me, even as thou slewest a living 'soul yesterday? Thou only desirest to be a tyrant in the land; thou desirest not to be of them that put things right.'"/>
		<aya index="20" text="Then came a man from the furthest part of the city, running; he said, 'Moses, the Council are conspiring to slay thee. Depart; I am one of thy sincere advisers.'"/>
		<aya index="21" text="So he departed therefrom, fearful and vigilant; he said, 'My Lord, deliver me from the people of the evildoers.'"/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he turned his face towards Midian he said, 'It may be that my Lord will guide me"/>
		<aya index="23" text="On the right way. And when he came to the waters of Midian he found a company of the people there drawing water, and he found, apart from them, two women holding back their flocks. He said, 'What is your business?' They said, 'We may not draw water until the shepherds drive off; and our father is passing old.'"/>
		<aya index="24" text="So he drew water for them; then he turned away to the shade, and he said, 'O my Lord, surely I have need of whatever good Thou shalt have sent down upon me."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then came one of the two women to him, walking modestly, and said, 'My father invites thee, that he may recompense thee with the wage of thy drawing water for us.' So when he came to him and had related to him the story, he said, 'Be not afraid; thou hast escaped from the people of the evildoers.'"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Said one of the two women, 'Father, hire him; surely the best man thou canst hire is the one strong and trusty.'"/>
		<aya index="27" text="He said, 'I desire to marry thee to one of these my two daughters, on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for eight years. If thou completest ten, that shall be of thy own accord; I do not desire to' press hard 'upon thee. Thou shalt assuredly find me, if God wills, one of the righteous.'"/>

		<aya index="29" text="So when Moses had accomplished the term and departed with his household, he observed on the side of the Mount a fire. He said to his household, 'Tarry you here; I observe a fire. Perhaps I shall bring you news of it, or a faggot from the fire, that haply you shall warm yourselves.'"/>
		<aya index="30" text="When he came to it, a voice cried from the right of the watercourse, in the sacred hollow, coming from the tree: 'Moses, I am God, the Lord of all Being.'"/>
		<aya index="31" text="'Cast down thy staff.' And when he saw it quivering like a serpent, he turned about retreating, and turned not back. 'Moses, come forward, and fear not; for surely thou art in security.'"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Insert thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without evil; and press to thee thy arm, that thou be not afraid. So these shall be two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Council; for surely they are an ungodly people.'"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Said he, 'My Lord, I have indeed slain a living soul among them, and I fear that they will slay me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Moreover my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I. Send him with me as a helper and to confirm I speak truly, for' I fear they will cry me lies.'"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Said He, 'We will strengthen thy arm by means of thy brother, and We shall appoint. to you an authority, so that they shall not reach you because of Our signs; you, and whoso follows you, shall be the victors.'"/>
		<aya index="36" text="So when Moses came to them with Our signs, clear signs, they said, 'This is nothing but a forged sorcery. We never heard of this among our fathers, the ancients.'"/>
		<aya index="37" text="But Moses said, 'My Lord knows very well who comes with the guidance from Him, and shall possess the Ultimate Abode; surely the evildoers will not prosper.'"/>
		<aya index="38" text="And Pharaoh said, 'Council, I know not that you have any god but me. Kindle me, Haman, a fire upon the clay, and make me a tower, that I may mount up to Moses' god; for I think that he is one of the liars.'"/>

		<aya index="5" text="O men, God's promise is true; so let not the present life delude you, and let not the Deluder delude you concerning God."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Surely Satan is an enemy to you; so take him for an enemy. He calls his party only that they may be among the inhabitants of the Blaze."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Those who disbelieve -- there awaits them a terrible chastisement; but those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- theirs shall be forgiveness and a great wage."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him, so that he thinks it is good? God leads astray whomsoever He will, and whomsoever He will He guides; so let not thy soul be wasted in regrets for them; God has knowledge of the things they work."/>

Yet of both you eat fresh flesh, and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear; and thou mayest see the ships cleaving through it, that you may seek of His bounty, and so haply you will be thankful."/>

'What, did We not give you long life, enough to remember in for him who would remember? To you the warner came; taste you now! The evildoers shall have no helper.'"/>
		<aya index="38" text="God knows the Unseen in the heavens and the earth; He knows the thoughts within the breasts."/>
		<aya index="39" text="It is He who appointed you viceroys in the earth. So whosoever disbelieves, his unbelief shall be charged against him; their unbelief increases the disbelievers only in hate in God's sight; their unbelief increases the disbelievers only in loss."/>

Or have We given them a Book, so that they are upon a clear sign from it? Nay, but the evildoers promise one another naught but delusion."/>
		<aya index="41" text="God holds the heavens and the earth, lest they remove; did they remove, none would hold them after Him. Surely He is All-clement, All-forgiving."/>
		<aya index="42" text="They have sworn by God the most earnest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more rightly guided than any one of the nations; but when a warner came to them, it increased them only in aversion,"/>
		<aya index="43" text="waxing proud in the land, and devising evil; but evil devising encompasses only those who do it; So do they expect anything but the wont of the ancients? And thou shalt never find any changing the Wont of God, and thou shalt never find any altering the wont of God."/>

		<aya index="5" text="The heavens wellnigh are rent above them, when the angels proclaim the praise of their Lord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Surely God -- He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate."/>
		<aya index="6" text="And those who have taken to them protectors apart from Him -- God is Warden over them; thou art not a guardian over them."/>
		<aya index="7" text="And so We have revealed to thee an Arabic Koran, that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and those who dwell about it, and that thou mayest warn of the Day of Gathering, wherein is no doubt -- a party in Paradise, and a party in the Blaze."/>
		<aya index="8" text="If God had willed, He would have made them one nation; but He admits whomsoever He will into His mercy, and the evildoers shall have neither protector nor helper."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Or have they taken to them protectors apart from Him? But God -- He is the Protector; He quickens the dead, and He is powerful over everything."/>
		<aya index="10" text="And whatever you are at variance on, the judgment thereof belongs to God. That then is God, my Lord; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn, penitent."/>
		<aya index="11" text="The Originator of the heavens and the earth; He has appointed for you, of yourselves, pairs, and pairs also of the cattle, therein multiplying you. Like Him there is naught; He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing."/>
		<aya index="12" text="To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He outspreads and straitens His provision to whom He will; surely He has knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="13" text="He has laid down for you as religion that He charged Noah with, and that We have revealed to thee, and that We charged Abraham with, Moses and Jesus: 'Perform the religion, and scatter not regarding it. Very hateful is that for the idolaters, that thou callest them to. God chooses unto Himself whomsoever He will, and He guides to Himself whosoever turns, penitent."/>
		<aya index="14" text="They scattered not, save after knowledge had come to them, being insolent one to another; and but for a Word that preceded from thy Lord until a stated term, it had been decided between them. But those to whom the Book has been given as an inheritance after them, behold, they are in doubt of it disquieting."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Therefore call thou, and go straight as thou hast been commanded; do not follow their caprices. And say: 'I believe in whatever Book God has sent down; I have been commanded to be just between you. God is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds, and you have your deeds; there is no argument between us and you; God shall bring us together, and unto Him is the homecoming.'"/>
		<aya index="16" text="And those who argue concerning God after that answer has been made to Him, their argument is null and void in the sight of their Lord; anger shall rest upon them, and there awaits them a terrible chastisement."/>
		<aya index="17" text="God it is who has sent down the Book with the truth, and also the Balance. And what shall make thee know? Haply the Hour is nigh."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Those that believe not therein seek to hasten it; but those who believe in it go in fear of it, knowing that it is the truth. Why, surely those who are in doubt concerning the Hour are indeed in far error."/>
		<aya index="19" text="God is All-gentle to His servants, providing for whomsoever He will. He is the All-strong, the All-mighty."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Whoso desires the tillage of the world to come, We shall give him increase in his tillage; and whoso desires the tillage of this world, We shall give him of it, but in the world to come he will have no share."/>
		<aya index="21" text="Or have they associates who have laid down for them as religion that for which God gave not leave? But for the Word of Decision, it had been decided between them. For the evildoers there awaits a painful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Thou seest the evildoers going in fear of that they have earned, that is about to fall on them; but those who believe and do righteous deeds are in Meadows of the Gardens; whatsoever they will they shall have with their Lord; that is the great bounty."/>
		<aya index="23" text="That is the good tidings God gives to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: 'I do not ask of you a wage for this, except love for the kinsfolk; and whosoever gains a good deed, We shall give him increase of good in respect of it. Surely God is All-forgiving, All-thankful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Or do they say, 'He has forged against God a lie?' But if God wills, He will set a seal on thy heart; and God blots out falsehood and verifies the truth by His words; He knows the thoughts within the breasts."/>
		<aya index="25" text="It is He who accepts repentance from His servants, and pardons evil deeds; He knows the things you do."/>
		<aya index="26" text="And He answers those who believe and do righteous deeds, and He gives them increase of His bounty. And the unbelievers -- for them awaits a terrible chastisement."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Had God expanded His provision to His servants, they would have been insolent in the earth; but He sends down in measure whatsoever He will; surely He is aware of and sees His servants."/>
		<aya index="28" text="And it is He who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His mercy; He is the Protector, the All-laudable."/>
		<aya index="29" text="And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and the crawling things He has scattered abroad in them; and He is able to gather them whenever He will."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Whatever affliction may visit you is for what you own hands have earned; and He pardons much."/>
		<aya index="31" text="You are not able to frustrate Him in the earth; and, apart from God, you have neither protector nor helper."/>
		<aya index="32" text="And of His signs are the ships that run on the sea like landmarks;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="and if He wills, He stills the wind, and they remain motionless on its back. Surely in that are signs for every man enduring, thankful."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Or He wrecks them for what they have earned; and He pardons much;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="and that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know they have no asylum."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life; but what is with God is better and more enduring for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord."/>
		<aya index="37" text="And those who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and when they are angry forgive,"/>
		<aya index="38" text="and those who answer their Lord, and perform the prayer, their affair being counsel between them, and they expend of that We have provided them,"/>
		<aya index="39" text="and who, when insolence visits them, do help themselves --"/>
		<aya index="40" text="and the recompense of evil is evil the like of it; but whoso pardons and puts things right, his wage falls upon God; surely He loves not the evildoers."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And whosoever helps himself after he has been wronged -- against them there is no way."/>
		<aya index="42" text="The way is only open against those who do wrong to the people, and are insolent in the earth wrongfully; there awaits them a painful chastisement."/>
		<aya index="43" text="But surely he who bears patiently and is forgiving -- surely that is true constancy."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Whomsoever God leads astray, he has no protector after him; and thou shalt see the evildoers, when they see the chastisement, saying, 'Is there any way to be sent back?'"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And thou shalt see them, as they are exposed to it, abject in humbleness, looking with furtive glance; and the believers shall say, 'Surely the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection; surely the evildoers are in lasting chastisement."/>
		<aya index="46" text="They have no protectors to help them, apart from God, and whomsoever God leads astray, no way has he.'"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Answer your Lord, before there comes a day from God that cannot be turned back; upon that day you shall have no shelter, no denial."/>
		<aya index="48" text="But if they turn away, We sent thee not to be a guardian over them. It is for thee only to deliver the Message. And when We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but if some evil befalls him for that his own hands have forwarded, then surely man is unthankful."/>
		<aya index="49" text="To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He will; He gives to whom He will females, and He gives to whom He will males"/>

		<aya index="51" text="It belongs not to any mortal that God should speak to him, except by revelation, or from behind a veil, or that He should send a messenger and he reveal whatsoever He will, by His leave; surely He is All-high, All-wise."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Even so We have revealed to thee a Spirit of Our bidding. Thou knewest not what the Book was, nor belief; but We made it a light, whereby We guide whom We will of Our servants. And thou, surely thou shalt guide unto a straight path --"/>
		<aya index="53" text="the path of God, to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens, and whatsoever is in the earth. Surely unto God all things come home."/>
