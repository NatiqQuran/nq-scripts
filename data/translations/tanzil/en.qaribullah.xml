	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="AlifLaamMeem."/>
		<aya index="2" text="That is the (Holy) Book, where there is no doubt. It is a guidance for the cautious (of evil and Hell)."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Who believe in the unseen and establish the (daily) prayer; who spend out of what We have provided them."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Who believe in that which has been sent down to you (Prophet Muhammad) and what has been sent down before you (to Prophets Jesus and Moses) and firmly believe in the Everlasting Life."/>
		<aya index="5" text="These are guided by their Lord; these surely are the prosperous."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Those who disbelieve, whether you forewarn them or not, they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and ears; their sight is dimmed and for them is a great punishment."/>
		<aya index="8" text="There are some people who say: 'We believe in Allah and the Last Day,'yet they are not believers."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none except themselves, though they do not sense it."/>
		<aya index="10" text="There is a sickness in their hearts which Allah has increased. For them there is a painful punishment because they lie."/>
		<aya index="11" text="When it is said to them, 'Do not corrupt in the land,' they reply, 'We are only reformers.'"/>
		<aya index="12" text="But it is they who are the evildoers, though they do not sense it."/>
		<aya index="13" text="When it is said to them: 'Believe as (other) people believe,' they reply, 'Are we to believe as fools believe?' It is they who are the fools, if only they knew!"/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet those who believe, they say, 'We, too believe.' But when they are alone with their devils, they say to them: 'We follow none but you, we were only mocking"/>
		<aya index="15" text="Allah will mock at them and prolong them in sin, blundering blindly."/>
		<aya index="16" text="Such are those who barter away guidance for error, their trade did not profit (them), nor are they guided."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their example is like one who kindled a fire, and when it lit all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness. They could not see."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Deaf, dumb, and blind, they shall never return."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or, like (those who, under) a cloudburst from the sky with darkness, thunder and lightning, they thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of every thunderclap for fear of death, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes upon them they walk on, but as soon as it darkens they stand still. Indeed, if Allah willed, He could take away their sight and hearing. Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O people, worship your Lord who has created you and those who have gone before you, so that you will be cautious."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky a dome, and has sent down water from the sky to bring forth fruits for your provision. Do not knowingly set up rivals to Allah."/>
		<aya index="23" text="If you are in doubt of what We have sent down to Our worshiper (Prophet Muhammad), produce a chapter comparable to it. Call upon your helpers, other than Allah, to assist you, if you are true."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you fail, as you are sure to fail, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the unbelievers."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Bear glad tidings to those who believe and do good works. They shall live in Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are given fruit as provision they will say: 'This is what we were given before,' for they shall be given in resemblance. Therein they shall have pure spouses, and shall live there for ever."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Allah is not shy to strike a parable whatsoever a gnat or larger. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord. As for those who disbelieve they ask: 'What could Allah mean by this parable? By it, Allah misleads many and guides many.' But He misleads none except the evildoers,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="who break the covenant of Allah after accepting it and sever what Allah has bidden to be joined and corrupt in the land. These are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How can you disbelieve Allah? Did He not give you life when you were dead, and He will cause you to die and then restore you to life. Then you will return to Him."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He created for you all that is in the earth, then, He willed to the heaven, and leveled them seven heavens. He has knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="30" text="When your Lord said to the angels: 'I am placing on the earth a caliph,' they replied: 'Will You put there who corrupts and sheds blood, when we exalt Your praises and sanctify You?' He said: 'I know what you do not know'"/>
		<aya index="31" text="He taught Adam (father of humans) the names all of them and then presented them to the angels, saying: 'Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful'"/>
		<aya index="32" text="'Exaltations to You,' they replied, 'we have no knowledge except that which You have taught us. You are indeed the Knowing, the Wise'"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Then He said to Adam: 'Tell them their names.' And when Adam had named them, He said: 'Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and earth, and all that you reveal and all that you hide'"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And when We said to the angels: 'Prostrate (to Me) yourselves towards Adam,' they all prostrated themselves except iblis (satan, father of the jinn), who, in his pride refused and became an unbeliever."/>
		<aya index="35" text="To Adam We said: 'Dwell with your wife in Paradise and both eat of it as much as you wish and wherever you will. But neither of you should come close to this tree or else you shall both become transgressors'"/>
		<aya index="36" text="But satan made them slip therefrom and caused them to depart from that in which they had been. 'Go down,' We said, 'be enemies to each other. The earth will provide your dwelling place an enjoyment for a while'"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam received Words from his Lord, and his Lord relented towards him. He is the Receiver of Repentance, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="'Go down, all together,' We said, 'so if a guidance shall come to you from Me, whosoever follows My guidance no fear shall be on them, neither shall they be saddened."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But those who disbelieve and belie Our verses shall be the companions of the Fire, and there they shall live for ever'"/>
		<aya index="40" text="'Children of Israel, remember My favor I have bestowed upon you. Fulfill My covenant, and I will fulfill your covenant with you. Me, you must fear."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in what I have sent down confirming what is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve it. Do not sell My verses for a little price and fear Me."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Do not confound truth with falsehood, nor knowingly hide the truth while you know."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Establish your prayers, pay the obligatory charity, and bow with those who bow."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Would you order righteousness on others and forget it yourselves? Yet you recite the Book, have you no sense?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And seek help in patience and prayer. For it is heavy, except to the humble,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="who reckon that they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will return."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Children of Israel, remember the favors I have bestowed on you, and that I have preferred you (the prophets among you) above the worlds."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Guard yourselves against the Day when no soul can avail a thing to another, when neither intercession nor ransom shall be accepted from it, nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="49" text="(Remember) how We saved you from Pharaoh's people who had oppressed you cruelly, slaying your sons and sparing your women. Surely, that was a great trial from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="We parted the sea for you, and, taking you to safety, drowned the family of Pharaoh before your eyes."/>
		<aya index="51" text="We appointed for Moses forty nights, but in his absence you took the calf, thereby committing harm."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Yet after that We pardoned you, so that you might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you might be guided;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="and when Moses said to his nation: 'My nation, you have harmed yourselves by taking the calf (to worship). So turn in repentance to your Creator and slay yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator.' And He shall accept you. He is the Receiver of Repentance, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when you said to Moses: 'We will not believe in you until we see Allah openly' a thunderbolt struck you whilst you were looking."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you from your death, so that you might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="57" text="We caused the clouds to cast their shadow over you and sent down for you manna and quails, (saying:) 'Eat of the good things We have provided you. 'Indeed, they did not harm Us, but they harmed themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="'Enter this village' We said, 'and eat wherever you will and as much as you wish. Make your way prostrating through the gates, saying: &quot;Unburdening.&quot; We shall forgive you your sins and We will increase the gooddoers'"/>
		<aya index="59" text="But the harmdoers tampered with Our Words, different from that said to them, and We let loose on the harmdoers a scourge from heaven as a punishment for their debauchery."/>
		<aya index="60" text="(Remember) when Moses prayed for water for his nation, We said to him: 'Strike the Rock with your staff' Thereupon twelve springs gushed from it, and each tribe knew their drinking place. 'Eat and drink of that which Allah has provided and do not act evilly in the land, corrupting'"/>
		<aya index="61" text="'Moses' you said, 'we will no longer be patient with one type of food. Call on your Lord to bring forth for us some of the produce of the earth, green herbs and cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions' 'What' he answered, 'Would you exchange that which is lesser for what is better? Go down into Egypt, there you shall find all that you have asked' Humiliation and abasement were pitched upon them, and they incurred the Anger of Allah; because they disbelieved His signs and slew His Prophets unjustly; because they disobeyed and were transgressors."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Those who believe, Jews, Nazarenes and Sabaeans whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good deeds shall be rewarded by their Lord; they have nothing to fear nor are they saddened."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, (saying) 'Take what We have given you forcefully and remember what is in it, so that you will be cautious'"/>
		<aya index="64" text="yet after that you turned away, but for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy you would have surely been among the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="You have surely known of those amongst you who transgressed the Sabbath. We said to them: 'Be apes, despised'"/>
		<aya index="66" text="We made it a punishment for the former times and for the latter, an exhortation to the cautious."/>
		<aya index="67" text="When Moses said to his nation: 'Allah commands you to slaughter a cow' they replied: 'Are you taking us in mockery' 'I seek protection with Allah lest I should be one of the ignorant' he said."/>
		<aya index="68" text="'Call on your Lord' they said, 'to make known to us what she shall be' He said: &quot;He says she is a cow neither old, nor virgin, middling between both.&quot; Therefore, do as you have been ordered'"/>
		<aya index="69" text="'Call on your Lord' they said, 'to make known to us what her color shall be' 'Your Lord says: &quot;The cow is yellow, a rich yellow pleasing to the onlookers.'"/>
		<aya index="70" text="'Call on your Lord' they said, 'to make known to us which cow she shall be; to us cows look alike. If Allah wills, we shall be guided'"/>
		<aya index="71" text="He replied: 'He says: &quot;She is a cow, neither worn out plowing the earth nor watering the field, one kept secure free from any blemish.' 'Now you have brought us the truth' they answered. And they slaughtered her, after they had been reluctant to do so."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And when you slew a soul and then fell out with one another concerning it, Allah made known what you concealed."/>
		<aya index="73" text="We said: 'Strike him with a piece of it' Like this, Allah restores the dead to life and shows you His signs in order that you will understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Yet after that your hearts became as hard as rock or even harder. Indeed among the stones are those from which rivers burst. And others split so that water issues from them; and others crash down through fear of Allah. Allah is not inattentive of what you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Do you then hope that they will believe in you, when some of them have already heard the Word of Allah and knowingly tampered with it, after they understood it!"/>
		<aya index="76" text="When they meet those who believe, they say: 'We are believers' But when alone, they say to their other (chiefs). 'Do you tell to them what Allah has revealed to you so that they will dispute with you concerning it with your Lord? Have you no sense'"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they not know that Allah has knowledge of all they hide and all that they reveal!"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And some of them are common (people) and do not know the Book, but only wishful thoughts, and they are only doubters."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say: 'This is from Allah' in order to gain a small price for it. So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for their earnings."/>
		<aya index="80" text="They say: 'The Fire will never touch us except for a number of days' Say: 'Did Allah make you such a promise for Allah never breaks His promise or do you say about Allah what you do not know'"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Indeed, he who earns evil and becomes engrossed in his sin, they are the people of the Fire; in it they shall remain for ever."/>
		<aya index="82" text="But those who believe and do good works are the people of Paradise; for ever they shall live in it."/>
		<aya index="83" text="(Remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, you shall worship none except Allah. Show kindness to your parents, to kinsmen, to the orphans, and to the needy, and speak of goodness to people. Establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity. But, except for a few, you all turned your backs and gave no heed."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And when We made a covenant with you, that you shall not shed your blood or turn yourselves out of your dwellings, to this you consented and bore witness."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Yet there you are, slaying your ownselves, and turning a number of them out of their dwellings, and helping each other against them with sin and aggression. Although, should they come to you as captives, you would ransom them. Surely, their expulsion was unlawful. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve another! What shall be the recompense of those of you who do that, but degradation in the worldly life, and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible punishment. Allah is not inattentive of what you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Such are they who buy the worldly life at the price of the Everlasting Life. Their punishment shall not be lightened, nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="87" text="To Moses We gave the Book and after him We sent other Messengers. We gave (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary, veritable signs, and supported him with the Spirit of Purity (Gabriel). Will you then become proud whenever any Messenger comes to you with that which does not suit your fancies, and you belied some (Prophet Jesus) and killed others!"/>
		<aya index="88" text="They say: 'Our hearts are covered' But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief. Little is that they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when a Book came to them from Allah confirming what was with them, while before that they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers when there came to them what they knew, they disbelieved him. Therefore, the curse of Allah be upon the unbelievers!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Evil is that for which they have bartered away their souls, that they disbelieve what Allah has sent down, grudging that Allah should send down from His bounty to whom He chooses from His worshipers! They have incurred wrath over wrath. For the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment."/>
		<aya index="91" text="When it is said to them: 'Believe in what Allah has sent down' they reply: 'We believe in what was sent down to us' But they disbelieve in what is sent after it, although it is the truth, confirming their own Book. Say: 'Why, before did you kill the Prophets of Allah, if you are believers'"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Moses came to you with clear signs, then you took to yourselves the calf after him and you were harmdoers'"/>
		<aya index="93" text="When We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you (saying): 'Take what We have given you forcefully and hear' they replied: 'We hear, but disobey' For their disbelief, they were made to drink the calf into their very hearts. Say: 'Evil is your belief that orders you to (worship the calf), if you are indeed believers'"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say: 'If the abode of the Everlasting Life is with Allah for you especially, to the exclusion of all other people, then long for death if you are truthful'"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will never long for it (death), because of what their hands forwarded; and Allah knows the harmdoers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Indeed, you will find them more eager than other people for this life. And (more than) those who disbelieve. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But his prolonged life will surely not remove him from the punishment. Allah is the Seer of what they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say: 'Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel, indeed, he has brought it down by the permission of Allah to your heart, confirming what was before it and a guidance and glad tidings to the believers."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Gabriel, and Michael indeed Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers'"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We have sent down to you clear verses, none will disbelieve them except the evildoers."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Why, whenever they make a promise do some of them cast it aside! Most of them do not believe."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And now that a Messenger has come to them from Allah confirming what was with them, some of those to whom the Book was given reject the Book of Allah behind their backs, as though they knew nothing"/>
		<aya index="102" text="and follow what the devils recited over the Kingdom of Solomon. Solomon did not disbelieve, it is the devils who disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was sent down upon the angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. They did not teach anyone, until both had said: 'We have been sent as a trial; do not disbelieve' From them they learned how they might separate a husband and his wife. However, they did not harm anyone with it, except by the permission of Allah. Indeed, they learned what harms them and does not profit them, yet they knew that anyone who buys it would have no share in the Everlasting Life. Evil is that for which they have sold their souls, if they but knew!"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Had they believed and were cautious, far better for them would be the reward from Allah, if they but knew."/>
		<aya index="104" text="'Believers, do not say 'Observe us (Ra'ina, in Hebrew means evil) ', but instead say: &quot;Look after us (Undhurna), and listen' for the unbelievers is a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="105" text="The unbelievers among the People of the Book (Jews and Nazarenes) and the idolaters resent that any good should have been sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses whom He will for His Mercy. And Allah is of great bounty."/>
		<aya index="106" text="If We supersede any verse or cause it to be forgotten, We bring a better one or one similar. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things!"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that it is to Allah that the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belong, and that there is none, other than Him, to protect or help you!"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Would you rather demand of your Messenger that which was once demanded of Moses! He who exchanges belief for disbelief has surely strayed from the Right Path."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the People of the Book wish they might turn you back as unbelievers after you have believed, in envy of their souls, after the truth has been clarified to them. So pardon and forgive until Allah brings His command. Allah is Powerful over everything."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity. Whatever good you shall forward for your soul you shall find it with Allah. He is the Seer of what you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="They say: 'None but Jews and Nazarenes shall be admitted to Paradise' Such are their wishful fancies. Say: 'Bring us your proof, if what you say is true'"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Indeed, whoever submits his face to Allah and does good works shall be rewarded by his Lord; there they shall have nothing to fear nor shall they be saddened."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say the Nazarenes are not on anything, and the Nazarenes say it is the Jews who are not on anything. Yet they both read the Book. And those who do not know say like their saying. Allah will judge between them their disputes on the Day of Resurrection."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Who does greater harm than he who prevents His Name to be remembered in the Mosques of Allah and strives to destroy them? Those, they will not enter them except in fear. And for them shame in this world and a great punishment in the next."/>
		<aya index="115" text="To Allah belong the east and the west. Whichever way you turn, there is the Face of Allah. He is the Embracer, the Knower."/>
		<aya index="116" text="They say: 'Allah has taken (to Himself) a son' Exaltations to Him (Allah). For Him is what is in the heavens and the earth, all are obedient to Him."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Creator of the heavens and the earth! When He decrees a thing, He only says: 'Be' and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And those who do not know say: 'Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us' Likewise, those who were before them said similar to their saying. Their hearts are alike. Indeed, We have clarified the signs to a nation who are certain."/>
		<aya index="119" text="We have sent you (Prophet Muhammad) forth with the truth, a giver of glad tidings and a giver of warning. You shall not be questioned about the companions of Hell."/>
		<aya index="120" text="You will please neither the Jews nor the Nazarenes unless you follow their creed. Say: 'The guidance of Allah is the guidance' And if after all the knowledge you have been given you yield to their desires, you shall not have, other than Allah, either a guide or a helper."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those to whom We have given the Book, and who recite it as it ought to be read, truly believe in it; those who disbelieve it shall be the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred your (prophets among you) above the worlds."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And fear a Day when no soul for another will compensate a thing, and no equivalent will be accepted from it, neither intercession will benefit it, nor shall they be helped."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And when Abraham was tested by His Lord with certain words and he fulfilled them, He said: 'I have appointed you as a leader for the nation' (Abraham) asked: 'And of my descendants' 'My covenant' said He, 'the harmdoers shall not receive it'"/>
		<aya index="125" text="And when We made the House (Ka'bah) a visitation and a sanctuary for the people (saying:) 'Make the place where Abraham stood a place of prayer. 'And We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael: 'Purify My House for those who circumambulate around it, and those who cleave to it, to those who bow and prostrate'"/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham said: 'My Lord, make this country safe and provide its inhabitants whosoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day with fruits' He said: 'And whosoever disbelieves, to him I shall give enjoyment for a while. Then I shall compel him to the punishment of the Fire, how evil an arrival'"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House (supplicating): 'O our Lord, accept this from us, You are the Hearer, the Knower."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Our Lord, make us both submissive to You, and of our descendants a submissive nation to You. Show us our rites and accept us; You are the Receiver of Repentance, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="129" text="Our Lord, send among them a Messenger from them who shall recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them; You are the Mighty, the Wise'"/>
		<aya index="130" text="And who has no desire for the religion of Abraham, except he who fooled himself? We chose him in this world, and in the Everlasting world, he shall be among the righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="When his Lord said to him: 'Submit' he answered: 'I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds'"/>
		<aya index="132" text="Abraham charged his children with this, and so did Jacob, saying: 'My sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion. Do not die except being submissive (Muslims)'"/>
		<aya index="133" text="Or, were you witnesses when death came to Jacob! He said to his children: 'What will you worship after me' They replied: 'We will worship your God and the God of your forefathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, the One God. To Him, we are submissive'"/>
		<aya index="134" text="That was a nation that has passed away. Theirs is what they earned, and yours what you have earned. You shall not be questioned about what they did."/>
		<aya index="135" text="They say: 'Be Jews or Nazarenes and you shall be guided' Say: 'No, rather the Creed of Abraham, the upright one. He was not among the idolaters'"/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say: 'We believe in Allah and that which is sent down to us, and in what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes; to Moses and Jesus and the Prophets from their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them, and to Him we are submissive (Muslims)'"/>
		<aya index="137" text="If they believe as you have believed they shall be guided; if they reject it, they shall surely be in clear dissension. Allah will suffice you. He is the Hearer, the Knower."/>
		<aya index="138" text="The (indelible) marking of Allah. And who marks better than Allah! And for Him we are worshipers."/>
		<aya index="139" text="Say: 'Would you dispute with us about Allah, who is our Lord and your Lord? Our deeds belong to us and your deeds belong to you. We are sincere to Him'"/>
		<aya index="140" text="Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes, were Jews or Nazarenes! Say: 'Who knows better, you or Allah? Who is more unjust than he who hides a testimony received from Allah? And Allah is not inattentive of what you do'"/>
		<aya index="141" text="That nation has passed away. Theirs is what they earned and yours what you have earned. You shall not be questioned about what they did."/>
		<aya index="142" text="The fools among the people will say: 'What has made them turn away from the direction they were facing' Say: 'The east and the west belong to Allah. He guides whom He will to the Straight Path'"/>
		<aya index="143" text="And so We have made you a median nation, in order that you will be a witness above the people, and that the Messenger be a witness above you. We did not change the direction that you were facing except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on both his heels. Though it was a hardship except for those whom Allah has guided. But Allah would never waste your faith. Indeed, Allah is Gentle with people, the Most Merciful."/>
		<aya index="144" text="We have seen you turning your face towards the heaven, We shall surely turn you to a direction that shall satisfy you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (built by Abraham); wherever you are, turn your faces to it' Those to whom the Book was given know this to be the truth from their Lord. Allah is not inattentive of what they do."/>

		<aya index="5" text="He said: 'O my son, say nothing of this vision to your brothers lest they should cunningly plot against you indeed, satan is the clear enemy of the human,"/>

		<aya index="7" text="Indeed, in Joseph and his brothers there were signs for those who inquire."/>
		<aya index="8" text="They said: 'Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than ourselves, even though we are many. Truly, our father is obviously wrong."/>
		<aya index="9" text="(Let us) kill Joseph, or cast him away in some (far off) land, so that your father's face will be left for you, and afterwards you will be a righteous nation'"/>

		<aya index="13" text="He said: 'It grieves me to let him go with you, for I fear lest the wolf should devour him when you are not paying attention to him'"/>
		<aya index="14" text="They said: 'We are many, if a wolf devours him, then we are losers'"/>
		<aya index="15" text="When they went with him, they agreed to put him in the bottom of a well. We revealed to him: 'You shall tell them of what they did when they are not aware (it is you)'"/>
		<aya index="16" text="At nightfall, they returned weeping to their father."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They said: 'We went racing and left Joseph with our things. The wolf devoured him, but you will not believe us, though we speak the truth'"/>
		<aya index="18" text="And they brought his shirt (stained) with blood, a lie. He said: 'No, your souls have tempted you to do something. But come sweet patience! The help ofAllah is always there to seek against that which you describe'"/>
		<aya index="19" text="Thereafter travelers came, and sent their waterman. And when he had let down his pail, (he cried:) 'Rejoice, a boy' Then they concealed him among their merchandise, but Allah knew what they did."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Then, they sold him for a trifling price, a number of dirhams, because they considered him to be of little value."/>
		<aya index="21" text="The Egyptian that bought him said to his wife: 'Make his stay honorable.

		<aya index="26" text="He (Joseph) said: 'It was she who sought to seduce me' and a witness (an infant) of her people bore witness, saying: 'If his shirt is torn from the front, she is speaking the truth and he is one of the liars,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="but, if his shirt is torn from behind, she lied, and he is of the truthful'"/>
		<aya index="28" text="And when he saw his shirt torn at the back, he said: 'This is one of your (women's) guiles. Your guile, (O woman), is great indeed!"/>
		<aya index="29" text="Joseph, turn away from this. And you, ask forgiveness for your sin. You are indeed one of the sinners'"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Certain women in the city said: 'The Governor's wife has sought to seduce her servant. He has made her heart stricken with love for him. Clearly, we perceive her to be in error'"/>
		<aya index="31" text="When she heard of their sly whispers, she sent for them and prepared a banquet. To each she gave a knife, (then called Joseph saying:) 'Come and attend to them' When they saw him, they were so taken with him that they cut their hands, and said: 'Allah save us! This is no mortal, he is no other but a noble angel'"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Whereupon she said: 'Now you see, this is he on whose account you blamed me. Yes, I sought to seduce him, but he was unyielding. If he declines to do what I command, he shall be imprisoned and be one of the humiliated'"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He supplicated: 'Lord, prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Yet if You do not shield me from their guile I shall yield to them and be one of the ignorant'"/>
		<aya index="34" text="His Lord answered him and He turned their guile away from him. Indeed, He is the Hearer, the Knower."/>

		<aya index="36" text="Two young men went to prison with him.

Tell us its interpretation, for we can see you are among the good'"/>
		<aya index="37" text="He said: 'Before any food comes to feed either of you, I will give you its interpretation. That which I will tell you has been taught to me by Allah. I reject the belief of a nation who do not believe in Allah and disbelieve in the Everlasting Life."/>
		<aya index="38" text="I follow the creed of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not for us to associate anything with Allah. Such is the favor of Allah to us, and to mankind. Yet most people do not give thanks."/>
		<aya index="39" text="My fellowprisoners, say which is better, many gods at variance, or Allah the One, the Conqueror?"/>
		<aya index="40" text="That which you worship, other than Him, are nothing but names which you and your fathers have named and for which Allah has sent down no authority. Judgement rests with Allah alone. He has commanded you to worship none except Him. That is the right religion, yet most people do not know."/>
		<aya index="41" text="My fellowprisoners, one of you will pour wine for his lord whereas the other will be crucified, and birds will peck at his head. The matter you inquired about has been decided."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And he said to the one of the two who he knew would be saved: 'Mention me in the presence of your lord' But satan made him forget to mention him to his master, so that he remained in prison for a certain number years."/>
		<aya index="43" text="The king said: 'I saw in a vision seven fatted cows being devoured by seven lean ones; and seven green ears of corn and seven others withered. My counselors, tell me the meaning of my vision, if you can interpret visions'"/>
		<aya index="44" text="They said: 'They are confused nightmares, nor do we know anything of the interpretation of visions'"/>
		<aya index="45" text="After all that time, the one of the two who had been saved remembered, he said: 'I will interpret it for you, so let me go'"/>
		<aya index="46" text="(He said:) 'Joseph, the truthful, tell us of the seven fatted cows that were devoured by seven lean ones also of the seven green ears of corn and the other seven which were withered, so that I can go back to the people and then they will then know'"/>
		<aya index="47" text="He replied: 'You shall sow for seven years as is your way. Leave in the ear (of corn) you reap, except a little which you eat."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Thereafter, seven hard years will come upon you, which will consume all but little of that which you have stored."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Then, there will come a year in which people are helped, in which the people will press'"/>
		<aya index="50" text="The king said: 'Bring him before me' But when the king's envoy came to him, he said: 'Go back to your lord and ask him: &quot;What about the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord knows their guile'"/>
		<aya index="51" text="'What was your business, women' he asked, 'when you solicited Joseph' 'Allah save us' they replied. 'We know no evil against him' The Governor's wife said: 'The truth has been discovered at last; I solicited him; he is among the truthful."/>

		<aya index="55" text="He (Joseph) said: 'Give me charge of the storehouses of the land, I am a knowledgeable guardian'"/>
		<aya index="56" text="And as such We established Joseph in the land to live wherever he liked. We bestow Our Mercy on whom We will, and We never waste the wage of therighteous."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Indeed, the reward of the Everlasting Life is better for those who believe and are cautious."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Joseph's brothers came and presented themselves before him. He recognized them, but they did not know him."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And when he had given them their provisions, he said: 'Bring me a certain brother from your father. Do you not see that I give just measure and am the bestof hosts?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="If you do not bring him to me, you shall receive no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you come near me (again)'"/>
		<aya index="61" text="They replied: 'We will ask our father for him. This we will surely do'"/>

		<aya index="65" text="When they opened their saddlebags, they found that their merchandise had been given back to them. 'Father' they said 'what more do we desire? Look, our merchandise has been returned to us. We will receive provisions for our family and we will look after our brother. We shall receive an extra camelload, that is an easy measure'"/>
		<aya index="66" text="He replied: 'I will never send him with you until you swear by Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you are prevented' And when they had given him their oath, he said: 'Allah is the Guardian of what we say'"/>
		<aya index="67" text="Then he said: 'My sons, do not enter from one gate. Enter through different gates. I cannot be of any help to you against Allah; judgement belongs to Allah alone. In Him I have put my trust. In Him let all put their trust'"/>
		<aya index="68" text="And when they entered from where their father had instructed them, nothing helped them against (the decree of) Allah. It was but a need in Jacob's soul which he had fulfilled. He possessed knowledge because of what We had taught him, though most people do not know."/>
		<aya index="69" text="When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother in his arms, and said: 'I am your brother. Do not grieve at what they did'"/>
		<aya index="70" text="And when he had given them their provisions, he hid a drinkingcup in his brother's saddlebag. Then a herald called out after them: 'Cameleers, you are thieves!'"/>

		<aya index="72" text="'We are missing the goblet of the king' he replied. 'Whosoever restores it shall have a camelload, that I guarantee'"/>

		<aya index="75" text="They replied: 'Its recompense in whosoever's saddle bag it is found, he shall be its recompense. As such we punish the harmdoers'"/>
		<aya index="76" text="He searched their bags before his brother's and then took out the goblet from his brother's bag. As such We directed Joseph. By the king's law he had no right to seize his brother unless Allah willed otherwise. We raise whom We will in rank; over every knowledgeable person is One who knows."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They said: 'If he is a thief know then that a brother of his has committed theft before him' But Joseph kept it secret and did not reveal it to them. He said:'You are in a worse position. And Allah knows well what you describe'"/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said: 'Mighty prince, his father is old, advanced in years, take one of us instead of him. We can see you are amongst the gooddoers'"/>
		<aya index="79" text="He replied: 'Allah forbid that we should seize any but he with whom our property was found, for then we should be harmdoers'"/>
		<aya index="80" text="When they despaired of him, they went in private to confer together. The eldest said: 'Do you not know that your father took a pledge from you in the Name of Allah, and that you failed before regarding Joseph?

		<aya index="85" text="They said: 'By Allah, will you not cease to mention Joseph until you are consumed, or are among the perishing'"/>
		<aya index="86" text="He replied: 'I complain to Allah of my anguish and sadness. I know from Allah what you do not know."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Go and seek news of Joseph and his brother. Do not despair of the Comfort of Allah, none but unbelievers despair of the Comfort of Allah'"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And when they presented themselves before him they said: 'O mighty prince, we and our people are afflicted with distress. We have brought but little merchandise. Fill up the measure, and be charitable to us; Allah rewards the charitable'"/>
		<aya index="89" text="'Do you know' he replied, 'what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance'"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They said: 'Are you Joseph' 'I am Joseph' he answered, 'and this is my brother. Allah has been gracious to us. Those who keep from evil and are patient, indeed, Allah does not let the wage of the good doers go to waste'"/>

		<aya index="100" text="He lifted his parents to the throne, and (the others) bowed before him. Joseph said to his father: 'This is the meaning of my vision of long ago, my Lord has verified it.

		<aya index="10" text="When the youths sought refuge in the Cave, they said: 'Lord give us from Your Mercy and furnish us with rectitude in our affair'"/>
		<aya index="11" text="For many years We sealed up their hearing in the Cave,"/>
		<aya index="12" text="and thereafter We revived them to find out which of the two parties could best calculate the length of their stay."/>
		<aya index="13" text="In truth We tell to you their news. They were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance."/>
		<aya index="14" text="We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said: 'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will call on no other god except Him; (for if we did), we would have spoken outrageously (in disbelief),"/>
		<aya index="15" text="These, our nation have taken to themselves gods, other than Allah. Why do they not bring some clear authority regarding them! Who does greater evil than he who forges a lie against Allah'"/>
		<aya index="16" text="When you depart from them and from what they worship, other than Allah, seek refuge in the Cave. Allah will extend His Mercy to you and will furnish you with a gentle issue of your affair."/>
		<aya index="17" text="You might have seen the rising sun incline towards the right of their Cave, and, as it set go past them on the left, while they stayed within an open space in the Cave. That was one of the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is rightly guided; but he whom He leads astray you shall not find for him a guardian to guide him."/>
		<aya index="18" text="You might have thought them awake, though they were sleeping. We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched its paws at the entrance. Had you seen them you would surely have become filled with terror and turned your back on them in flight."/>
		<aya index="19" text="As such We revived them so that they might question one another. 'How long have you stayed here' asked one of them. 'We have been here a day, or part of it' they replied. They said: 'Your Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. Let one of you go to the city with this silver (coin) and let him search for one who has the purest food and bring provision from it. Let him be courteous, but let no one sense it is you."/>
		<aya index="20" text="For, if they appear in front of you, they will stone you to death or restore you to their religion. Then you will never prosper'"/>
		<aya index="21" text="And so We made them (the unbelievers) stumble upon them, so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about theHour. They argued among themselves over their affair, then (the unbelievers) said: 'Build a building over them (their remains). Their Lord knows best who they were. 'But those who prevailed over the matter said; 'We will build around them a Mosque'"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Some will say: 'They were three; their dog was the fourth' Others, guessing at the Unseen, will say: 'They were five and their dog was the sixth' And yet others: 'Seven; their dog was the eighth' Say: 'My Lord knows best their number. Except for a few none know their number' Therefore, do not dispute with them except in outward disputation, and do not ask any of them concerning them."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Do not say of anything: 'I will do it tomorrow'"/>
		<aya index="24" text="unless (you add) 'if Allah wills' And remember your Lord when you forget and say: 'It may be that my Lord will guide me to something nearer to rectitude than this'"/>
		<aya index="25" text="And they stayed in the Cave three hundred years and to that they added nine more."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Say: 'None but Allah knows how long they stayed. To Him belong the Unseen in the heavens and the earth. How well He sees, and how well He hears! They have no other guardian, other than Him, and He allows no one (to share) His rule'"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Recite what is revealed to you in the Book of your Lord. No one can change His Words. You shall find no refuge other than Him."/>
		<aya index="28" text="And be patient with those who call to their Lord in the morning and evening, desiring His Face. And do not turn your eyes away from them desiring the good things of this life, nor obey he whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance; so that he follows his own lust, and his affair has become excessive."/>
		<aya index="29" text="Say: 'This is the truth from your Lord. Let whosoever will, believe, and whosoever will, disbelieve it' For the harmdoers, We have prepared a Fire, the pavilion of which encompasses them. When they cry out for relief, they shall be showered with water as hot as molten copper, which will scald their faces; how evil a drink, and how evil a restingplace!"/>
		<aya index="30" text="As for those who believe and do good works We do not waste the wage of whosoever does good works."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Those, they shall live in the Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow. They shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and arrayed in green garments of silk, and brocade, reclining therein on couches; how excellent is their reward and how fine is their resting place!"/>
		<aya index="32" text="Give them the parable of two men. To one we gave two gardens of vines and surrounded them with palm trees and in between the two we placed a sownfield."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Each of the two gardens yielded its produce and did not fail in the least and We made a river to gush through them,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="so he had fruit. As he spoke with his companion, as he was conversing with him, 'My wealth is more abundant than yours and men have a greater respect for me'"/>
		<aya index="35" text="And when, having wronged himself, he entered his garden, he said: 'I do not think that this will ever perish!"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Nor do I think that the Hour will come. Even if I returned to my Lord, I should surely find a better place than this'"/>
		<aya index="37" text="His companion said, during his conversation with him: 'What, do you disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then from a spermdrop, and then fashioned you into a man!"/>
		<aya index="38" text="He is Allah, my Lord, and I will not associate anyone with My Lord."/>
		<aya index="39" text="When you entered your garden why did you not say: &quot;If Allah wills; there is no power except by Allah.&quot; Though you see me lesser than yourself in wealth and children,"/>
		<aya index="40" text="maybe my Lord will give me a garden better than yours, and send down a thunderbolt from heaven, so that in the morning it will be a slope of dust,"/>
		<aya index="41" text="or, in the morning its water will be drained into the earth so that you will not have a means to reach it'"/>
		<aya index="42" text="And all his fruit were destroyed, and in the morning he wrung his hands with grief at all he had spent on it, for it had collapsed upon its trellises, and he said: 'Would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord'"/>
		<aya index="43" text="He had no host to help him besides Allah, and he was helpless"/>
		<aya index="44" text="that Day. Supremacy belongs only to Allah, the True. He is the best to reward and the best ending."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Give to them a parable about this present life. It is like water We have sent down from the sky with which the plants of the earth mingle, and in the morning it is straw the wind scatters. Allah is Powerful over all things."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Wealth and children are the ornament of this present life. But the things that last and good deeds, are better with your Lord in reward and hope."/>
		<aya index="47" text="And on the Day when We shall set the mountains in motion and you shall see the earth a leveled plain; when We gather them together, and would not leave even one behind,"/>
		<aya index="48" text="and they shall be presented in ranks before your Lord (who will say to them:) 'You have returned to Us as We created you the first time. No, you claimed We would not appoint a meeting for you!"/>
		<aya index="49" text="And the Book shall be set in place, and you will see the sinners fearful of what is in it' They shall say: 'Woe to us! How is it, this book omits nothing small or great, all are counted' And they shall find what they did is present, and Your Lord will wrong no one."/>
		<aya index="50" text="When We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam' all prostrated themselves except iblis, who was one of the jinn, disobedient to the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants to be your guardians, other than Me, when they are your clear enemy? How evil is the exchange for the harmdoers!"/>
		<aya index="51" text="Neither did I make them witnesses at the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor at their own creation. I would never take those who lead others astray to be My supporters."/>
		<aya index="52" text="And the Day He will say: 'Call on those whom you claimed to be My associates' They will invoke them, but they will receive no answer, for We shall place a gulf between them."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when the evildoers see the Fire of Hell they will reckon it is there they shall fall. They shall find no escape from it."/>
		<aya index="54" text="We have set forth for people in this Koran all manner of parables; the human is the most disputatious of things."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Nothing prevented people from believing and seeking the forgiveness of their Lord when guidance came to them, unless they are waiting for the fate of the ancients to overtake them, or that the punishment should come upon them face to face."/>
		<aya index="56" text="We send Our Messengers only to proclaim glad tidings and to give warning. But the unbelievers dispute with false arguments so that they may belie the truth. They have taken My verses and warnings in mockery."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Who is greater in evil than he who, when reminded of the verses of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent before him? We have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it, and there is heaviness in their ears. Even if you call them to guidance, they will never be guided."/>
		<aya index="58" text="Your Lord is Forgiving, Owner of Mercy. Had it been His will to take them to task for what they earned, He would have hastened their punishment; but they have an appointed hour from which they will never escape."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And those villages! When they became evil We destroyed them and appointed a meeting for their destruction."/>
		<aya index="60" text="When Moses said to his (assisting) youth: 'I will not give up until I reach the point where the two seas meet even though I should go on for many years'"/>
		<aya index="61" text="But when they came to the point where the two met, they forgot their fish, which made its way burrowing into the sea."/>
		<aya index="62" text="And when they had gone further, he said to his assisting youth; 'Bring us our breakfast; we are worn out from our journey'"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He replied: 'What do you think, I forgot the fish when we were resting on the rock. None but satan made me forget to mention this it made its way into the sea in a marvelous fashion'"/>
		<aya index="64" text="'This is what we have been seeking' said he, and they retraced their footsteps"/>
		<aya index="65" text="and found one of Our worshipers to whom We had given from Our Mercy, and to whom We had taught knowledge of Ours."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said to him: 'May I follow you so that you can teach me of that you have learned of righteousness'"/>
		<aya index="67" text="'You will not bear patiently with me' He replied."/>
		<aya index="68" text="'For how can you bear patiently with that which you have never encompassed in your knowledge'"/>
		<aya index="69" text="He (Moses) said: 'If Allah wills, you shall find me patient, I shall not disobey your order'"/>
		<aya index="70" text="He said: 'If you follow me, you must not question me about anything till I myself speak to you concerning it'"/>
		<aya index="71" text="So they departed. When they boarded a ship, he bored a hole in it. 'What, have you made a hole in it' he said, 'is it to drown its passengers? You have done a dreadful thing'"/>
		<aya index="72" text="'Did I not I tell you' he replied, 'that you would not bear patiently with me'"/>
		<aya index="73" text="Moses said: 'Do not blame me for what I forgot, nor press me to do something which is too difficult'"/>
		<aya index="74" text="and so they departed. Thereafter they met a boy and he killed him. He (Moses) exclaimed: 'What, have you killed a pure soul and it was not done (in retaliation) for a soul you have done a terrible thing'"/>
		<aya index="75" text="'Did I not tell you' he replied, 'that you would not be able to bear patiently with me'"/>
		<aya index="76" text="He (Moses) said: 'If I question you again do not let me be your companion; you already have enough excuse'"/>
		<aya index="77" text="So they departed and thereafter they came to the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for some food, but they declined to host them. There, they found a wall about to fall down whereupon his companion restored it. He (Moses) said: 'Had you wished, you could have taken payment for that'"/>
		<aya index="78" text="He said: 'This is the parting between me and you. But now I will tell you the interpretation of that which you could not patiently bear."/>
		<aya index="79" text="As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the sea. I rendered it imperfect because behind them there was a king who was taking every ship by brutal force."/>
		<aya index="80" text="As for the boy, his parents are believers, and we were afraid lest he should impose on them with his insolence and disbelief."/>
		<aya index="81" text="It was our wish that their Lord should grant them another in exchange, another better in purity and tenderness."/>
		<aya index="82" text="As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city. Beneath it was (buried) a treasure which belonged to them. Their father had been a righteous person and your Lord willed that when they reach manhood to bring out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. What I did was not done by my own command. That is the interpretation of what you could not bear with patience'"/>
		<aya index="83" text="They will ask you about ThulKarnain (the pious and chosen). Say: 'I will recite to you something of his story."/>
		<aya index="84" text="We established him in the land and gave him means to all things."/>
		<aya index="85" text="He journeyed on a way"/>
		<aya index="86" text="until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and nearby he found a nation. 'ThulKarnain' We said, 'you must either punish them or show them kindness'"/>
		<aya index="87" text="He replied: 'The evildoer we shall punish. Then he shall return to his Lord and He will punish him with a stern punishment."/>
		<aya index="88" text="As for he who believes and does good works he shall receive a fine reward in recompense and we shall speak to him with a mild command'"/>
		<aya index="89" text="Then he followed the road,"/>
		<aya index="90" text="until he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for whom We provided no veil against it to shade them."/>
		<aya index="91" text="So, We encompassed in knowledge what was with him."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Then he followed the road,"/>
		<aya index="93" text="when he reached between the two barriers he found on one side of them a nation who could barely understand speech."/>
		<aya index="94" text="'ThulKarnain' they said, 'Look, Gog and Magog are corrupting the earth. Build for us a barrier between us and them, and we will pay you a tribute'"/>
		<aya index="95" text="He replied: 'That which my Lord has given me is better, therefore help me with all your power, and I will build a barrier between you and between them."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Bring me ingots of iron' After he had leveled between the two cliffs, he said: 'Blow' And when he made it a fire, he said: 'Bring me molten copper so that I may pour over it'"/>
		<aya index="97" text="Thereafter they could neither scale it, nor could they pierce it."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said: 'This is a mercy from my Lord. But when my Lord's promise is come, He will make it dust. The promise of my Lord is true'"/>
		<aya index="99" text="On that day, We will let them surge on one another, and the Horn shall be blown, and We will gather them all together."/>
		<aya index="100" text="On that Day We shall present Gehenna (Hell) to the unbelievers,"/>

		<aya index="5" text="But We wanted to be gracious to those abased in the land, and to make them leaders and inheritors,"/>

		<aya index="7" text="We revealed this to Moses' mother: 'Suckle him, but when you fear for him cast him into the water. Neither fear, nor sorrow because We shall restore him to you and make him among the Messengers'"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then the family of Pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy and a sorrow for them, indeed Pharaoh and Haman, and their army were sinners."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Pharaoh's wife said to him: 'He will be a comfort to me and you. Do not slay him, perhaps he may benefit us, or we will take him for our son' But they were unaware."/>

		<aya index="13" text="So, We restored him to his mother, so that she might be comforted and not sorrow, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. Yet most of them do not know."/>

		<aya index="16" text="Forgive me, my Lord, for I have wronged myself' and so He forgave him; for He is indeed the Forgiving, the Most Merciful."/>
