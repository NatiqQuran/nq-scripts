	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif. Lam. Mim."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who ward off (evil)."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We have bestowed upon them;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="5" text="These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, when they believe not."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not."/>
		<aya index="10" text="In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We are peacemakers only."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Are not they indeed the mischief-makers? But they perceive not."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: shall we believe as the foolish believe? are not they indeed the foolish? But they know not."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but mock."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy."/>
		<aya index="16" text="These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, where they cannot see,"/>
		<aya index="18" text="Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps, for fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers (in His guidance, His omniscience and His omnipotence)."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is able to do all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you, so that ye may ward off (evil)."/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy; and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know (better)."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness beside Allah if ye are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for ever they abide."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude? He misleadeth many thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the earth: Those are they who are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you! Then He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will return."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He to the heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a viceroy in the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee? He said: Surely I know that which ye know not."/>
		<aya index="31" text="And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying: Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful."/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide."/>
		<aya index="34" text="And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye freely (of the fruits) thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="36" text="But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the (happy) state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto the other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam received from his Lord words (of revelation), and He relented toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh unto you from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples of the Fire. They will abide therein."/>
		<aya index="40" text="O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and fulfil your (part of the) covenant, I shall fulfil My (part of the) covenant, and fear Me."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess already (of the Scripture), and be not first to disbelieve therein, and part not with My revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty unto Me."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who bow (in worship)."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget (to practise it)? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no sense?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the humble-minded,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are returning."/>
		<aya index="47" text="O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to (all) creatures."/>
		<aya index="48" text="And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="49" text="And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk, who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women: that was a tremendous trial from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned the folk of Pharaoh in your sight."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights (of solitude), and then ye chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion (of right and wrong), that ye might be led aright."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves by your choosing of the calf (for worship) so turn in penitence to your Creator, and kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you the manna and the quails, (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you - they wronged Us not, but they did wrong themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And when We said: Go into this township and eat freely of that which is therein, and enter the gate prostrate, and say: &quot;Repentance.&quot; We will forgive you your sins and will increase (reward) for the right-doers."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven for their evil-doing."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth."/>
		<aya index="61" text="And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for their disobedience and transgression."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Lo! Those who believe (in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabaeans - whoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And (remember, O Children of Israel) when We made a covenant with you and caused the mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil)."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated!"/>
		<aya index="66" text="And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and an admonition to the Allah-fearing."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us? He answered: Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish!"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor immature; (she is) between the two conditions; so do that which ye are commanded."/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow cow. Bright is her colour, gladdening beholders."/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright."/>
		<aya index="71" text="(Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And (remember) when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding."/>
		<aya index="73" text="And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened and became as rocks, or worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush, and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And indeed there are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what ye do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood it, knowingly?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe. But when they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of that which Allah hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning it? Have ye then no sense?"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from hearsay. They but guess."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say, &quot;This is from Allah,&quot; that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn thereby."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And they say: The Fire (of punishment) will not touch us save for a certain number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah - truly Allah will not break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not?"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of the Garden. They will abide therein."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And (remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none save Allah (only), and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being averse."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And when We made with you a covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your people nor turn (a party of) your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto)."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression? - and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah's sovereignty), and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a messenger (from Allah) with that which ye yourselves desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay?"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know (to be the truth) they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime, if ye are (indeed) believers?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="And Moses came unto you with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), yet, while he was away, ye chose the calf (for worship) and ye were wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers."/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind (as ye pretend), then long for death (for ye must long for death) if ye are truthful."/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and (greedier) than the idolaters. (Each) one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (a thousand years) would be no means remove him from the doom. Allah is Seer of what they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who hath revealed (this Scripture) to thy heart by Allah's leave, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers;"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael! Then, lo! Allah (Himself) is an enemy to the disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will disbelieve in them."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside? The truth is, most of them believe not."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming that which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not,"/>
		<aya index="102" text="And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two (angles) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew."/>
		<aya index="103" text="And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would be better, if they only knew."/>
		<aya index="104" text="O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): &quot;Listen to us&quot; but say &quot;Look upon us,&quot; and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that Allah is Able to do all things?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any guardian or helper?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime? He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send before (you) for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of what ye do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what ye state) if ye are truthful."/>
		<aya index="112" text="Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing (true), and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing (true); yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even thus speak those who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for their ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear. Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom."/>
		<aya index="115" text="Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay, but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto Him."/>
		<aya index="117" text="The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us, or some sign come unto us? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those (who were) before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for people who are sure."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire."/>
		<aya index="120" text="And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah (Himself) is Guidance. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting guardian nor helper."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to (all) creatures."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And guard (yourselves) against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession be of use to it; nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and he fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind. (Abraham) said: And of my offspring (will there be leaders)? He said: My covenant includeth not wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="125" text="And when We made the House (at Makka) a resort for mankind and sanctuary, (saying): Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to pray). And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, (saying): Purify My house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves (in worship)."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and bestow upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day, He answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's end!"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us (this duty). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="129" text="Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, Wise."/>
		<aya index="130" text="And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself? Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds."/>
		<aya index="132" text="The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, (saying): O my sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) religion; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered (unto Him)."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons: What will ye worship after me? They said: We shall worship thy god, the god of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One Allah, and unto Him we have surrendered."/>
		<aya index="134" text="Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they earned, and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="135" text="And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters."/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered."/>

And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness) the other will remember. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witnesses when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do (harm to them) lo! it is a sin in you.

The expiation thereof is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed your own folk, or the clothing of them, or the liberation of a slave, and for him who findeth not (the wherewithal to do so) then a three days' fast. This is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn; and keep your oaths. Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations in order that ye may give thanks."/>

		<aya index="79" text="Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such as can find naught to give but their endeavours, and deride them - Allah (Himself) derideth them. Theirs will be a painful doom."/>
		<aya index="80" text="Ask forgiveness for them (O Muhammad), or ask not forgiveness for them; though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk."/>

Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Never stand (to pray) there. A place of worship which was found upon duty (to Allah) from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein, wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers."/>

Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph."/>

		<aya index="120" text="It is not for the townsfolk of Al-Madinah and for those around them of the wandering Arabs so stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his life. That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of Allah, nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers, nor gain they from the enemy a gain, but a good deed is recorded for them therefor. Lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the good."/>

		<aya index="16" text="And they came weeping to their father in the evening."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth."/>
		<aya index="18" text="And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe."/>
		<aya index="19" text="And there came a caravan, and they sent their waterdrawer. He let down his pail (into the pit). He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did."/>
		<aya index="20" text="And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they attached no value to him."/>
		<aya index="21" text="And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the good."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in Allah! Lo! he is my lord, who hath treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper."/>
		<aya index="24" text="She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom?"/>
		<aya index="26" text="(Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars."/>
		<aya index="27" text="And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the truthful."/>
		<aya index="28" text="So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: Lo! this is of the guile of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great."/>
		<aya index="29" text="O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin. Lo! thou art of the faulty."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And women in the city said: The ruler's wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aberration."/>
		<aya index="31" text="And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and said (to Joseph): Come out unto them! And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is no a human being. This is not other than some gracious angel."/>
		<aya index="32" text="She said: This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me, and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish."/>
		<aya index="34" text="So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer, Knower."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And it seemed good to them (the men-folk) after they had seen the signs (of his innocence) to imprison him for a time."/>
		<aya index="36" text="And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: I dreamed that I was pressing wine. The other said: I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we see thee of those good (at interpretation)."/>
		<aya index="37" text="He said: The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah. This is of the bounty of Allah unto us (the seed of Abraham) and unto mankind; but most men give not thanks."/>
		<aya index="39" text="O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or Allah the One, Almighty?"/>
		<aya index="40" text="Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not."/>
		<aya index="41" text="O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: Mention me in the presence of thy lord. But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord, so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry. O notables! Expound for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams."/>
		<aya index="44" text="They answered: Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And he of the two who was released, and (now) at length remembered, said: I am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth."/>
		<aya index="46" text="(And when he came to Joseph in the prison, he exclaimed): Joseph! O thou truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry, that I may return unto the people, so that they may know."/>
		<aya index="47" text="He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual, but that which ye reap, leave it in the ear, all save a little which ye eat."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them, save a little of that which ye have stored."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Then, after that, will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops and when they will press (wine and oil)."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And the king said: Bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto him, he (Joseph) said: Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands. Lo! my Lord knoweth their guile."/>
		<aya index="51" text="He (the king) (then sent for those women and) said: What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph? They answered: Allah Blameless! We know no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the truth is out. I asked of him an evil act, and he is surely of the truthful."/>
		<aya index="52" text="(Then Joseph said: I asked for) this, that he (my lord) may know that I betrayed him not in secret, and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the betrayers."/>
		<aya index="53" text="I do not exculpate myself. Lo! the (human) soul enjoineth unto evil, save that whereon my Lord hath mercy. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person. And when he had talked with him he said: Lo! thou art to-day in our presence established and trusted."/>
		<aya index="55" text="He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land. Lo! I am a skilled custodian."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of it where he pleased. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We lose not the reward of the good."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who believe and ward off (evil)."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And Joseph's brethren came and presented themselves before him, and he knew them but they knew him not."/>
		<aya index="59" text="And when he provided them with their provision he said: Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father. See ye not that I fill up the measure and I am the best of hosts?"/>
		<aya index="60" text="And if ye bring him not unto me, then there shall be no measure for you with me, nor shall ye draw near."/>
		<aya index="61" text="They said: We will try to win him from his father: that we will surely do."/>
		<aya index="62" text="He said unto his young men: Place their merchandise in their saddlebags, so that they may know it when they go back to their folk, and so will come again."/>
		<aya index="63" text="So when they went back to their father they said: O our father! The measure is denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, surely we will guard him well."/>
		<aya index="64" text="He said: Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you aforetime? Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them. They said: O our father! What (more) can we ask? Here is our merchandise returned to us. We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother, and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load). This (that we bring now) is a light measure."/>
		<aya index="66" text="He said: I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of Allah that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded. And when they gave him their undertaking he said: Allah is the Warden over what we say."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust."/>
		<aya index="68" text="And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob's soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not."/>
		<aya index="69" text="And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying: Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did."/>
		<aya index="70" text="And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag, and then a crier cried: O camel-riders! Lo! ye are surely thieves!"/>
		<aya index="71" text="They cried, coming toward them: What is it ye have lost?"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They said: We have lost the king's cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it."/>
		<aya index="73" text="They said: By Allah, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and are no thieves."/>
		<aya index="74" text="They said: And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars?"/>
		<aya index="75" text="They said: The penalty for it! He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Then he (Joseph) began the search with their bags before his brother's bag, then he produced it from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless Allah willed. We raise by grades (of mercy) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They said: If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said (within himself): Ye are in worse case, and Allah knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege."/>
		<aya index="78" text="They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness."/>
		<aya index="79" text="He said: Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="80" text="So, When they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them said: Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in Allah's name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime? Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth for me. He is the Best of Judges."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Return unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled hither. Lo! we speak the truth."/>
		<aya index="83" text="(And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience! It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And he turned away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing."/>
		<aya index="85" text="They said: By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish!"/>
		<aya index="86" text="He said: I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair not of the Spirit of Allah. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save disbelieving folk."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And when they came (again) before him (Joseph) they said: O ruler! Misfortune hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise, so fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us. Lo! Allah will requite the charitable,"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He said: Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah hath shown us favour. Lo! he who wardeth off (evil) and endureth (findeth favour); for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly."/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred thee above us, and we were indeed sinful."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said: Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father's face, he will become (again) a seer; and come to me with all your folk."/>
		<aya index="94" text="When the caravan departed their father had said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard."/>
		<aya index="95" text="(Those around him) said: By Allah, lo! thou art in thine old aberration."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more. He said: Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not?"/>
		<aya index="97" text="They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us, for lo! we were sinful."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He said: I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him, and said: Come into Egypt safe, if Allah will!"/>
		<aya index="100" text="And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate, and he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren. Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He is the Knower, the Wise."/>

So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled."/>

But if ye are invited, enter, and, when your meal is ended, then disperse. Linger not for conversation. Lo! that would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything, ask it of them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him. Lo! that in Allah's sight would be an enormity."/>

		<aya index="58" text="And those who malign believing men and believing women undeservedly, they bear the guilt of slander and manifest sin."/>
		<aya index="59" text="O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad). That will be better, so that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful."/>
		<aya index="60" text="If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be your neighbours in it but a little while."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter."/>

		<aya index="63" text="Men ask thee of the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it is with Allah only. What can convey (the knowledge) unto thee? It may be that the Hour is nigh."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Lo! Allah hath cursed the disbelievers, and hath prepared for them a flaming fire,"/>
		<aya index="65" text="Wherein they will abide for ever. They will find (then) no protecting friend nor helper."/>
		<aya index="66" text="On the day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they say: Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and had obeyed His messenger!"/>

		<aya index="71" text="He will adjust your works for you and will forgive you your sins. Whosoever obeyeth Allah and His messenger, he verily hath gained a signal victory."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Lo! We offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the hills, but they shrank from bearing it and were afraid of it. And man assumed it. Lo! he hath proved a tyrant and a fool."/>
		<aya index="73" text="So Allah punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women, and idolatrous men and idolatrous women. But Allah pardoneth believing men and believing women, and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful."/>
