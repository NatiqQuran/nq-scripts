		<aya index="1" text="Alif. Lam Mim"/>
		<aya index="2" text="This Book whereof there is no doubt, is a guidance unto the God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Who believe in the Unseen, and establish prayer, and out of that wherewith We have provided them expend."/>
		<aya index="4" text="And who believe in that which hath been sent down unto thee and that which hath been sent down before thee and of the Hereafter they are convinced."/>
		<aya index="5" text="These are on guidance from their Lord, and these they are the blissful ones."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Verily those who have disbelieved, it is equal to them whether thou warnest them or warnest them not; they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah hath set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their sights is a covering; and unto them shall be a torment mighty."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And of mankind are some who say: we believe in Allah and in the Last Day: whereas they are not believers."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They would deceive Allah and those who believe, whereas they deceive not save themselves, and they perceive not."/>
		<aya index="10" text="In their hearts is a disease, so Allah hath increased unto them that disease; and unto them shall be a torment afflictive, for they have been lying."/>
		<aya index="11" text="And when it said unto them: act not corruptly on the earth, they say: we are but reconcilers."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Lo! verily it is they who are the corrupters, and yet they perceive not."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when it said unto them: believe even as mankind have believed, they say: shall we believe even as the fools have believed? Lo! verily it is they who are the fools; and yet they know not."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when they meet those who have believed, they say: We believe. And when they are alone with their Satans, they say: verily we are with you, we were but mocking."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Allah mocketh back at them, and letteth them in their exorbitance wander bewildered."/>
		<aya index="16" text="These are they who purchased error for guidance, but their traffic profited not, nor have they ever become guided."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their likeness is as the likeness of him who kindleth a fire, then when it hath lit up that which is around him, Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darknesses where they see not"/>
		<aya index="18" text="Deaf, dumb, blind; wherefore they will not return."/>
		<aya index="19" text="like unto a rain--laden cloud from heaven, wherein are darknesses and thunder and lightening. They so put their fingers in their ears because of the thunder-claps, guarding against death, and Allah is Encompasser of the infidels."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning well-nigh snatcheth away their sight; whensoever it flasheth on them, they walk therein, and when it becometh dark unto them, they stand still. And had Allah willed He would of a surety have taken away their hearing and their sights; verily Allah is over everything potent."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O Mankind worship your Lord who hath created you and those before you, haply ye may become God-fearing-"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who hath made the earth for you a carpet and the heaven a structure, and sent down from heaven water, and brought forth therewith fruits as a Provision for you; wherefore set not up compeers unto Allah while ye know."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if ye be in doubt concerning that which We have revealed unto Our bondsman, then bring a chapter like thereunto, and call your witnesses as against Allah, if ye say sooth."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if ye do it not, --and by no means ye shall, --then dread the Fire, the fuel whereof is men and stones, gotten ready for the infidels."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And bear thou the glad tidings unto those who believe and do righteous works that verily for them shall be Gardens whereunder rivers flow. So oft as they shall be provided with a fruit therefrom they will say: this is that wherewith we were provided afore; and they shall be vouchsafed that which is consimilar; and for them shall be therein spouses purified, and therein they shall be abiders."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Verily Allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude, be it of a gnat or of aught above it. Then as to those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And to those who disbelieve, they say what intendeth God by similitude? He sendeth many astray thereby, and He guideth many thereby, and He sendeth not astray thereby any except the transgressors,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Who break the covenant of Allah after the ratification thereof, and sunder that which Allah hath commanded should be joined, and act corruptly on the earth. These! they are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How will ye disbelieve in Allah whereas ye were lifeless and he quickened you; thereafter He will cause you to die, thereafter He will give you life, thereafter unto Him ye shall be returned!"/>
		<aya index="29" text="He it is who created for you all that is on the earth, thereafter He turned to the heaven, and formed them seven heavens. And He is of everything the Knower."/>
		<aya index="30" text="And recall what time thine Lord said unto the angels: verily I am going to place a vicegerent On the earth. They said: wilt Thou place therein one who will act corruptly therein and shed blood While we hallow Thine praise and glorify Thee! Allah said: verily I know that which ye know not."/>
		<aya index="31" text="And He taught Adam the names, all of them; thereafter He set them before the angles, and said declare unto Me the names of those if ye say sooth."/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said: hallowed be Thou no knowledge is our save that which Thou hast taught us, verily Thou! Thou art the Knower, Wise."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Allah said: O Adam! declare thou unto them the names of those objects. Then when he had declared unto them the names of those, He said: said I not unto you, verily I know the hidden in the heavens and the earth, and know that which ye disclose and that which ye are wont to conceal!"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And recall what time We said unto the angels: prostrate yourselves before Adam, they prostrated themselves; but not Iblis he refused and was stiff - necked and became of the infidels."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said: Adam! dwell thou and thine spouse in the Garden, and eat ye twain plenteously thereof as ye list, but approach not yonder tree, lest yet twain become of the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Then the Satan caused the twain to slip on account thereof, and drave them forth from that which the twain were in. And We said: get ye down, one of you an enemy unto anot her, and for you on the earth shall be a resting-place and enjoyment for a season."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain Words, and He relented toward him, verily He! He is the Relentant, the Merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said: get ye all down from hence, and if there cometh unto you a guidance from Me, then whosoever shall follow Mine guidance, -- no fear shall come on them, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="39" text="And those who disbelieve and belie Our signs, --they, shall be fellows of the Fire; therein they shall be abiders."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Children of Israel! remember My favour wherewith favoured you, and fulfil My covenant, and shall fulfil your covenant, and Me alone shall ye dread."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in that which I have sent down confirming that which is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and barter not My revelations for a small price, and Me alone shall ye fear."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And confound not the truth with falsehood, nor hide the truth while ye know."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And establish prayer, and give the poor-rate, and bow down with those who bow down."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Command ye mankind to piety and forget yourselves, the while ye read the Book! Understand then ye not!"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And seek help in patience and prayer and verily it is, hard except prayer unto the meek."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Who know that verily they are going to meet their Lord, and that verily unto Him they are going to return,"/>
		<aya index="47" text="O Children of Israel: remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and that verily I preferred you over the world."/>
		<aya index="48" text="And fear a Day whereon not in aught shall a soul satisfy for a soul, nor shall intercession be accepted thereof, shall compensation be received therefor, nor shall they be succoured."/>
		<aya index="49" text="And recall what time We delivered you from the house of Fir'awn imposing upon you evil torment, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; and therein was a trial, from your Lord, Mighty."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And recall what time We separated the sea for you and delivered you and drowned Fir'awn's house while ye looked on."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And recall what time We treated with Musa forty nights, then ye betook the calf after him, and ye were wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Then We pardoned you thereafter, that haply ye may return thanks."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And recall what time We vouchsafed unto Musa the Book and the distinction that haply ye may be guided."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And recall what time Musa said unto his people: my people! verily ye have wronged your souls by your taking the calf, wherefore repent unto your Maker, and slay yourselves: that were best for you with your Maker. Then He relented toward you; verily He! He is the Relentant, the Merciful"/>
		<aya index="55" text="And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we will not believe in thee until we see God openly; then a thunderbolt took hold of you while ye looked on."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you after your death that haply ye may return thanks."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And We overshadowed you with Clouds and We sent down unto you the Manna and the quails, saying: eat of the clean things, wherewith We have provided you. And they wronged Us not, but themselves they were wont to wrong."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And recall what time We said: enter this town and eat plenteously therefrom as ye list, and enter the gate prostrating yourselves and say: forgiveness; We shall forgive you your trespasses, and anon We shall increase unto the well-doers."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Then those who did wrong changed the Word that had been told them for anot her; so We sent down upon those who did wrong a scourge from heaven, for they were wont to transgress."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And recall what time Musa prayed for drink for his people. We said: smite With thy staff the stone. Then there gushed forth thereout twelve springs; every people already knew their drinking-place; eat and drink of the provision of Allah, and commit not evil on the earth as corrupters."/>
		<aya index="61" text="And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we shall by no means bear patiently with one food, wherefore supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth, of its vegetables, and its cucumbers, and its Wheat, and its lentils, and its onions. He Said: would ye take in exchange that which is mean for that which is better! Get ye down into a City, as verily therein is for you that which ye ask for. And stuck upon them were abjection and poverty. And they drew on themselves indignation from Allah. This, because they were ever disbelieving in the signs of Allah and slaying the prophets without justice. This, because they disobeyed and were ever trespassing."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Verily those who believe, and those who are Judaised, and the Nazarenes, and the Sabians, - whosoever, believeth in Allah and the Last Day and worketh righteously, these! unto them shall be their hire with their Lord, no feal shall come on them nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And recall what time We took your bond, and raised over you the Tur saying: hold fast to that which We have vouchsafed unto you, and remember that which is therein, that haply ye may become God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Then ye turned away there after; so had not the grace of Allah been unto you and His mercy, ye had surely become of the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And assuredly ye know of those of you who trespassed in the matter of the Sabbath, wherefore We said unto them: be ye apes despised."/>
		<aya index="66" text="And We made it a deterrent unto those of their day and those after them, and an exhortation unto the God-fearing."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And recall what time Musa said unto his people: verily Allah commandeth you that ye slaughter a cow. They said: makest thou a jest of us? He said take refuge with Allah that I should be of the ignorant."/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said: supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He make manifest unto us whatever she should be. He said: verily He saith, she should be a cow neither old nor young, but middle-aged betwixt that; do then as ye are commanded."/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said: supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He make manifest unto us whatever her colour should be. He said: verily He saith, she should be a yellow cow the colour whereof is deepest, delighting the beholders."/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He make manifest unto us whatever she should be, for verily the cow hath become dubious unto us and verily we, if God will, shall beguided."/>
		<aya index="71" text="He said: verily He saith, verify she should be a cow unyoked, not broken to till the ground or to water the field, whole, and without blemish in her. They said: now hast thou brought the truth. Then they slaughtered her, and they were wellnigh not doing it."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And recall what time ye slew a person, then quarrelled among yourselves respecting it, and Allah was to bring out that which ye were hiding."/>
		<aya index="73" text="Wherefore We said: smite him with part of her. Thus will Allah quicken the dead and He sheweth you His signs that haply ye may under stand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then your hearts hardened thereafter, so they are as stones or stronger in hardness: and verily of stones there are some from which gush forth rivers, and verily there are of them some that cleave asunder and water issueth therefrom, and verily there are of them some that fall down in awe of Allah: and Allah is not neglectful of that which ye work."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Covet ye then that they would believe for you whereas surely a Party of them hath been hearing the Word of Allah and then reverting it after they have understood it, While they know."/>
		<aya index="76" text="And when they meet those who believe they say: we believe; and when some of them are alone with some others they say speak ye unto them of that which God hath opened unto you so that they may argue therewith against you before your Lord? understand then ye not?"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Know they not that Allah knoweth that which they hide and that which they make known?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And of them are unlettered ones who know not the Book but vain desires; and they do but conjecture."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Woe then unto those who write out the Book with their hands and say thereafter: this is from God, that they may barter it for a small price. Woe then unto them for that which thei hands had written; and woe unto them for that which they earn therwith."/>
		<aya index="80" text="And they say: Fire shall touch us not save for a few numbered days. Say thou: have ye taken a covenant with Allah, so that Allah shall not fail His covenant? or fabricate ye against Allah that which ye know not"/>
		<aya index="81" text="O Yea! whosoever earnoth vice and his sin hath encompassed him, those shall be the fellows of the Fire, as abiders therein."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those who believe and do righteous works, --those shall be the fellows of the Garden, as abiders therein."/>
		<aya index="83" text="And recall what time We took a bond with the Children of Israel saying: worship not any god save Allah, and unto parents show kindness, and also unto the kindred and the orphans and the poor, and speak kindly unto mankind, and establish prayer and give the poor rate. Then ye turned away, save a few of you, and ye are backsliders."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And recall what time We took a bond with you: saying: ye shall not shed your blood, nor drive one anot her from your homes; then ye ratified it and ye Were witnesses"/>
		<aya index="85" text="Thereafter it is ye the very ones who slay each other and drive a party of you from their homes, and back up against them with guilt and iniquity; and if they come unto you as captives, ye ransom them, whereas forbidden unto you was their driving away itself. Believe ye then in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? What, then, is to be the meed of those of you who do that, save humiliation in the life of the world? And on the Day of Judgement they shall be brought back to the severest torment, and Allah is not neglectful of that which ye work."/>
		<aya index="86" text="These are they who have purchased the life of the world for the Hereafter; wherefore the torment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be succoured."/>
		<aya index="87" text="And assuredly We vouchsafed unto Musa the Book and We followed him up by the apostles after him, and unto 'lsa, son of Maryam, We vouchsafed evidences and aided him with the Holy Spirit. Then so often as there came unto you an apostle with that which your souls desired not, ye waxed stiff necked; and some ye belied and some ye slew?"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say: our hearts are uncircumcised. Nay! Allah hath cursed them because of their infidelity: little wherefore it is they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when there came unto them a Book from before Allah confirming that which was with them, --and afore they were entreating God for victory over these who disbelieved, -then when there came unto them that which they recognised. they disbelieved therein wherefore Allah's curse be on the infidels!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Vile is that for which they have bartered their souls, that they should disbelieve that which Allah hath sent down, out of envy that Allah should reveal, out of His grace, unto whosoever of His bond men He listeth. Wherefore they have drawn upon themselves wrath upon wrath, and unto the infidel shall be a torment ignominious."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when it said unto them believe in that which Allah hath sent down now, they say: we believe in that which hath been sent down unto Us. And they disbelieve in that which is besides that while it is the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say thou: wherefore then slew ye Allah's prophets afore, a if ye have been believers?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="And assuredly Musa came unto you with evidence, then ye betook the calf after him, and ye were wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And recall what time We took your bond and raised over you the Tur, saying: hold fast to that which We have vouchsafed unto you and hearken. They said: we hear and we disobey. And into their hearts the calf was made to sink because of their infidelity. Say thou: vile is that which your belief commandeth you, if ye are believers."/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say thou: if for you alone is the abode of the Hereafter with Allah to the exclusion of mankind, then wish for death if ye say sooth."/>
		<aya index="95" text="And they will by no means ever wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent on before; and Allah is the Knower of the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="And surely thou wilt find them the greediest of men after life, even greedier than those who associate. Each one of them would fain life for a thousand years, and this will not save him from the torment, even if he hath lived so long. And Allah is the Beholder of that which they work."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say thou: whosoever is an enemy unto Jibril, ----then verily he it is Who hath brought down this Revelation, by Allah's command, to thine heart, confirming that which went before, and a guidance and glad tidings unto the believers."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Whosoever is an enemy unto Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibril and Mikail, then verily Allah is an enemy unto the infidels."/>
		<aya index="99" text="And assuredly We have sent down Unto thee evident signs, and none shall disbelieve therein save the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Is it that whenever they enter into a covenant some party among them cast it aside? Aye! most of them even believe not."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And whenever there came unto them an apostle from Allah confessing to that which was with them, a Party among those who were vouchsafed the Book, cast Allah's Book behind their backs as though they knew not."/>
		<aya index="102" text="And they follow that which the Satans recited in the reign of Sulaiman; and Sulaiman blasphemed not, but the Satans blasphemed.; teaching people magic; and they follow that also which was sent down unto the two angels in Babil, Harut, and Marut. Unto none the twain taught it until they had said: We are but a temptation, so blaspheme not; but they learned from the twain that wherewith they might separate man from his wife; and they could harm none thereby save by Allah's will. And they have learnt that which harmeth them, and profiteth them not; and assuredly they know that whosoever purchaseth it, his is no portion in the Hereafter. And surely vile is the price for which they have bartered themselves, if they but knew!"/>
		<aya index="103" text="And had they believed and feared, surely better had been the reward from before Allah, if they but knew!"/>
		<aya index="104" text="O O Ye who believe! say not: Ra'ina, but say: Unzurna, and hearken; and unto the infidel shall be a torment afflictive."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Fain would they who disbelieve, be they of the people of the Book or of the associators, that naught of good should be sent down unto you from Your Lord; whereas Allah singleth out for His mercy whomsoever He will and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Whatsoever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten We bring a better one or the like thereof; knowest thou not that Allah is over everything Potent?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Knowest thou not that verily Allah! His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth? and for you beside Allah is no protector or helper."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Seek ye to question your apostle, even as Musa was questioned afore. And whosoever changeth belief for infidelity, he hath of a surety strayed from the even way."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Fain would Many of the People of the Book turn you back infidels after ye have believed, out of envy from their, after the truth hath become manifest unto them so Pardon them, and pass over, until Allah sendeth His command. Verily Allah is over everything Potent."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And establish prayer and give the poor-rate. and whatsoever of good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find with Allah; verily Allah is the Beholder of that which ye work."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say: none shall enter the Garden except he be a Jew or a Nazarene. Such are their vain desires! Say thou: forthwith your proof if ye say"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Aye! whosoever submitteth himself unto Allah and he is a well-doer-his hire is with his Lord; no fear shall come on them nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="113" text="And the Jews say: the Nazarenes are not grounded on aught: and the Nazarenes say: the Jews are not grounded on aught While they recite the same Book. Even so say those who know not, the like of their saying. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding that wherein they have been differing."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who is more unjust than he who preventeth the mosques of Allah, that His name be mentioned therein, and striveth after their ruin? These! it was not for them to enter therein except in fear. Unto them shall be humiliation in this World, and unto them in the Hereafter a torment mighty."/>
		<aya index="115" text="And unto Allah belongeth the east and the west; so withersoever you turn there is the countenance of Allah: verily Allah is pervading, Knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And they Say: God hath betaken unto Him a son! Hallowed be He: Aye unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth: ', all are unto Him devout"/>
		<aya index="117" text="The Originator of the heavens and the earth; and whensoever He decreeth an affair, He only saith unto it: be; and it becometh."/>
		<aya index="118" text="And those who know not, say: Wherefore speakest not God unto us? or cometh not unto us a sign? Thus aid those before them the like of their saying: consimilar are their hearts. We have already manifested the signs unto the people who would be convinced."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Verily We have sent thee with the truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and thou shalt not be questioned of the fellows of the Flame."/>
		<aya index="120" text="And the Jews will never be pleased with thee, nor the Nazarenes, except thou follow their faith. Say thou: verily the guidance of Allah, --that is the guidance. And of a surety wert thou to follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of the knowledge, there will be for thee against Allah neither protector nor helper."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those unto whom We have vouchsafed the Book and they recite it as it ought to be recited - they shall believe therein and whosoever disbelieveth therein, those then! they shall be the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O Children of Isra'il! remember My favour wherewith favoured you, and that I preferred you over the world."/>
		<aya index="123" text="And fear a Day whereon not in aught shall a soul satisfy for a soul, nor shall compensation be accepted therefor, nor shall intercession profit it, nor shall they be succoured."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And recall what time his Lord Proved Ibrahim with certain words then he performed them. He said: verily I am going to make thee a leader unto mankind. Ibrahim said: and also of my progeny? Allah said: My covenant shall not reach the wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="125" text="And recall what time We appointed the House a resort unto man kind and a place of security and said: take the station of Ibrahim for a place of prayer. And We covenanted with Ibrahim and Ismai'l, saying: purify ye twain My Houses for those who shall circumambulate it and those who shall stay, and those who shall bow down and prostrate themselves."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And recall what time Ibrahim said: my Lord! make this city a place of security, and provide the People thereof with fruits, - such of them as will believe in Allah and the last Day. Allah said: and whosoever will disbelieve, him also shall give enjoyment for a while; thereafter I shall drive him to the torment of the Fire, - an ill abode!"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And recall what time Ibrahim was raising the foundation of the House and also Ismai'l, praying: our Lord! accept of us; verily Thou! Thou art the Hearer, the Knower!"/>
		<aya index="128" text="Our Lord! make us twain submissive unto Thee, and of our progeny community submissive unto Thee, and show us our rites, and relent toward us! verily Thou! Thou art the Relentant, the Merciful!"/>
		<aya index="129" text="Our Lord! raise up unto them an apostle from among them, who shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall teach them the Book and wisdom, and shall cleanse them. Verily Thou! Thou art the Mighty, the Wise."/>
		<aya index="130" text="And who shall be averse from the faith of Ibrahim, save one who befooleth his soul! And assuredly We chose him in this World, and verily he in the Hereafter shall be of the righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="Recall what time his Lord said unto him: submit, he said: I submit to the Lord of the Worlds."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And Ibrahim enjoined his sons the same and did Ya'qub also, saying: O my sons! verily Allah hath chosen for you the religion, so die not except ye be Muslims."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Were ye witnesses when death presented itself to Ya'qub, what time he said unto his sons: what will ye worship after me! They said: we shall worship the God the God of thy fathers, Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq, and unto Him we are submissive."/>
		<aya index="134" text="That are a community who have passed away, unto them shall be that which they earned and unto you that which ye earn, and ye shall be questioned not of that which they were wont to Work."/>
		<aya index="135" text="And they say: become Jews or Nazarenes, and ye shall be guided. Say thou: Aye! we follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright, and he was not of the associators."/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say: we believe in Allah and that which hath been sent down unto us and that which was sent down unto Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Musa and lsa, and that which was vouchsafed unto the prophets from their Lord; we differentiate not between any of them, and unto Him are submissive."/>
		<aya index="137" text="So if they believe in the like of that which ye believe in, surely they are guided; but if they turn away, then they are but in Cleavage. So Allah will suffice thee against them and He is the Hearer, the Knower."/>

		<aya index="83" text="And what hath made thee hasten from thy people, O Musa?"/>
		<aya index="84" text="He said: those! they are close on my footstep, and hastened to Thee, O my Lord; that Thou mightest be wellpleased."/>
		<aya index="85" text="He said: verily We have tempted thy people after thee, and the Samiri hath led them astray."/>
		<aya index="86" text="So Musa returned unto his people, indignant and sorrowful. He said: O my people! promised there not your Lord unto you an excellent promise! Lasted then the covenant too long for you, or desired ye that the wrath from your Lord should alight on you, so that ye failed to keep my appointment?"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: we failed not to keep thy appointment of our own authority, but we were laden with burthens of the people's ornaments; then we threw them, and Thus Samiri cast down."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And he produced for them a calf: a body with a low. Then they Said: this is your god and the god of Musa, and that he forgat."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Observed they not that it returned not unto them a word, and owned not for them hurt or profit?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="And assuredly Harun had said unto them afore: O my people! ye are only being tempted thereby; and verily your Lord is the Compassionate; so follow me and obey my command."/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: we shall by no means cease to be assiduous to it until there returneth to us Musa."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Musa said: O Harun! what prevented thee, when thou sawest them going astray."/>
		<aya index="93" text="That thou followedst me not! Hast thou disobeyed my command?"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Harun said: O my mother's son! hold me not by my beard nor by my head verily feared that thou wouldst say, thou hast caused a division among the Children of Israel and hast not guarded my Word."/>
		<aya index="95" text="Musa said: what was thy object, O Samiri?"/>
		<aya index="96" text="He said: l saw that which they saw not; so I seized a handful from the footstep of the messenger, and then cast it; Thus my soul embellished the affair to me."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Musa said: begone thou! verily it shall be thine in life to say no contact; and verily thine is an appointment which thou shalt by no means fail. And look at thy god to which thou hast been assidauous; we shall surely burn it, and we shall scatter it into the sea a wide scattering."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Your God is only Allah, the One other than whom there is no god. He comprehendeth everything in knowledge."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Thus We recount unto thee some tidings of that which hath preceded; and surely We have vouchsafed unto thee from before Us an admonition."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Whosoever turnoth away therefrom--verily they shall bear on the Day of Judgment a burthen,"/>

		<aya index="106" text="Then He shall leave it a plain, level."/>
		<aya index="107" text="Wherein thou shalt not see any crookedness or ruggedness."/>

		<aya index="112" text="And whosoever worketh of the righteous works, and is a believer, he will not fear Wrong or begrudging"/>
		<aya index="113" text="And Thus We have sent it down, an Arabic Recitation, and have propounded variously therein of the threats, that haply they may fear, or that it may generate in them some admonition."/>

		<aya index="116" text="And recall what time We said to the angels: prostrate yourselves before Adam. They fell prostrate, but Iblis did not; he refused."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Then We said: Adam! verily this is an enemy unto thee and thine spouse; so let him not drive forth you twain from the Garden, lest thou be destressed."/>

		<aya index="119" text="Nor that thou shalt thirst therein nor shall suffer from the sun."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Then the Satan whispered unto him; he said: Adam! shall direct thee to the tree of eternity and a dominion that ageth not!"/>
		<aya index="121" text="Then the twain ate thereof; so there became disclosed to them their shame, and they began sewing upon them selves some of the leaves of the Garden, so Adam disobeyed his Lord, and erred,"/>
		<aya index="122" text="Thereafter his Lord accepted him, and relented toward him, and guided him."/>
		<aya index="123" text="He said: get ye twain down therefrom together: some of you an enemy unto some others; then if there cometh unto you from Me guidance, whosoever followeth My guidance shall neither go astray nor be distressed."/>
		<aya index="124" text="And whosoever turneth away from My admonition, for him verily will be a livelihood shrunken, and We shall raise him up on the Day of Judgment sightless."/>

		<aya index="4" text="Verily Fir'awn exalted himself in the earth and made the people thereof into sects, weakening a party among them, slaying their sons and letting their women live. Verify he was of the corrupters."/>
		<aya index="5" text="And We desired that We should be gracious unto those who were weakened in the land, and We should make them leaders and We should make them the inheritors."/>
		<aya index="6" text="And We should establish them in the earth, and We should let Fir'awn and Haman and their hostee from them that which they dreaded."/>
		<aya index="7" text="And We inspired the mother of Musa, saying: suckle him, then when thou fearest for him, cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily We are going to restore him unto thee, and shall make him one of the sent ones."/>

		<aya index="11" text="And she said unto his sister: follow him. So she watched him from afar; and they perceived not."/>
		<aya index="12" text="And We had aforetime forbidden foster-mothers for him; so she said: shall direct you unto a household who will rear him for you and who will be unto him good counsellors."/>
		<aya index="13" text="So We restored him unto his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. Yet most of them know not."/>
		<aya index="14" text="And when he attained his full strength and became firm, We vouchsafed unto him wisdom and knowledge; and Thus We reward the well- doers."/>
		<aya index="15" text="And he entered the City at a time of unawareness of the inhabitants thereof, and he found therein two men fighting, one being of his own party, and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his party, called him for help against him who was of his enemies. So Musa truck him with his fist, and put an end of him. He said: this is of the work of the satan, verily he is an enemy, a misleader manifest."/>

		<aya index="23" text="And when he arrived at the water of Madyan, he found there a community of the people watering. And he found, apart from them, two women keeping back their flocks. He said: what aileth you twain! The twain said: we water not until the shepherds have driven away their flocks; and our father is a very old man."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Then he watered their flocks for the twain. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said: my Lord! I verily of the good which Thou mayest send down for me I am needy."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then there came unto him one of the twain walking bashfully, and said: verily my father calleth for thee, that he may recompense thee with a hire for that thou didst water the flock for us. Then, when he was come unto him and had recounted unto him the whole story, he said: fear not; thou hast escaped from the wrong-doing people."/>
		<aya index="26" text="And said one of the twain: O my father! hire him, for the best that thou canst hire is the strong and trustworthy one."/>

		<aya index="29" text="Then when Musa had fulfilled the term, and was journeying with his household, he saw a fire on the side of Tur, and said unto his household: bide ye; verily I see a fire afar, haply I may bring unto you tidings thereon, or a brand out: of the fire, haply ye may warm yourselves."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Then when he was come thereto, he was called from the right side of the valley in the ground blest from the tree: Musa! verily I! I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="And cast thou down thy staff. And when he saw it stirring, as though it were a serpent, he turned in flight and looked not back. O Musa! draw nigh, and fear not; thou art of the secure ones."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Slip thy hand in thy bosom, it shall come forth white without hurt; and draw back thy arm unto thee for fear. These shall be two proofs from thy Lord unto Fir'awn and his chiefs; verily they have been a people given to transgression."/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: My Lord! verily I have slain a man among them and I fear they shall slay me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="And My brother Harun! He is more eloquent than I in speech; wherefore send him with me as a support, to corroborate me; verily I fear that they shall belie me."/>
		<aya index="35" text="He said: We shall indeed strengthen thine arm with thy brother, and We shall vouchsafe unto you authority, so that they shall not be able to come up to you. Go forth with Our signs! Ye twain and those who follow you, shall be the victors."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Then when Musa came unto them with Our manifest signs, they said: this is naught but magic fabricated; and we heard not of this among our fathers of old."/>
		<aya index="37" text="And Musa said: My Lord best knoweth him who bringeth guidance from before Him and him whose will be the happy end of the Abode. Verily the wrong-doers shall not thrive."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And Fir'awn said: O chiefs! know not of a god for you except me. Wherefore light thou for me, O Haman! clay, and make me a lofty tower that I may ascend unto the God of Musa; and verily I imagine him to be of the liars."/>
		<aya index="39" text="And he and his hosts were stiff-necked in the land without right, and imagined that before Us they would not be brought back."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Wherefore We laid hold of him and his hosts and cast them into the sea. So behold thou what like hath been the end of the wrong- doers!"/>
		<aya index="41" text="And We made them leaders calling to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall not be succoured."/>
		<aya index="42" text="And We caused a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be of the castaway."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And assuredly We vouchsafed the the Scripture unto Musa after We had destroyed the generations of old: enlightenment unto mankind and a guidance and a mercy, that haply they might be admonished."/>
		<aya index="44" text="And thou wast not on the western side when We decreed the affair unto Musa, and thou wast not of the witnesses."/>
		<aya index="45" text="But We brought forth generations, and prolonged unto them was life; nor wast thou a dweller among the people of Madyan, reciting unto them Our revelations; but it is We who were to send."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Nor wast thou beside the Tur when We called; but thou art sent as a mercy from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn a people unto whom no warner came before thee, that haply they might be admonished."/>
		<aya index="47" text="And lest, if an affliction had afflicted them for that which their hands had sent before, they should have said: our Lord! wherefore sent not Thou an apostle unto us that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the believers!"/>
		<aya index="48" text="Yet when the truth is come unto them from before Us, they say: wherefore hast he not been vouchsafed the like of that which was given unto Musa? Disbelieved they not in that which was given unto Musa aforetime? They say; two magics supporting each other. And they say: verily in all such things we are disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say thou: then bring a Book from before Allah, that is better in guidance than these two shall follow it--if ye are truth- tellers."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Then if they answer thee not, know thou that they only follow their own desires; and who is farther astray than he who followeth his desire without guidance from Allah? Verily Allah guideth not a wrong- doing people."/>

		<aya index="52" text="Those unto whom We vouchsafed the Book before it, --they believe therein."/>

		<aya index="55" text="And when they hear vain discourse they withdraw therefrom and say: unto US our works, and unto you your works; peace be unto you; we seek not the ignorant."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Verily thou shalt not guide whomsoever thou lovest, but Allah shall guide whomsoever He will. And He knoweth best who are the guided."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And they say: were we to follow the guidance with thee, We Shall be snatched away from our land. Have We not established for them an inviolable sanctuary whereunto fruits of every sort are brought: a provision from Our presence? But most of them know not."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And how many a city have We destroyed that exulted in their living! And yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them unless for a little while; and verily We! We have been the inheritors."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Nor was thy Lord to destroy the Cities, until He had raised up in their mother-city an apostle reciting unto them our revealations. Nor were We to destroy the cities unless the inhabitants thereof were wrong-doers."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And whatsoever ye are vouchsafed is an enjoyment of the life of the world and an adornment thereof; and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will ye not therefore reflect?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Is he, then, whom We have promised an excellent promise which he is going to meet, like unto him whom We have suffered to enjoy awhile the enjoyment of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection he shall be of those brought up!"/>
		<aya index="62" text="And on the Day whereon He shall call unto them and say: where are My associates whom ye were wont to assert?"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those upon whom the sentence will be pronounced will say: our Lord these are they whom we seduced, we seduced them even as we our selves were seduced. We declare ourselves quit of them before Thee; not our selves they were wont to worship."/>

		<aya index="75" text="We shall take out from every community a witness and We shall say: come forth with your proof; then they shall know that the truth was Allah's, and astray will go from them that which they were wont to fabricate."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Verily Qarun was of the people of Musa; then he behaved arrogantly toward them. And We had vouchsafed him of the treasures whereof the keys would have weighed down a band of strong men. Recall what time his people said unto him: exult not; verily God loveth not the exultant."/>
		<aya index="77" text="And seek the abode of the Hereafter with that which God hath vouchsafed thee, and forget not thy portion in the World, and be thou bounteous even as God hath been bounteous unto thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; verily Allah loveth not corrupters."/>
