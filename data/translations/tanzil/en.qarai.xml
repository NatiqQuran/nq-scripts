	<sura index="2" name="البقرة">
		<aya index="1" text="Alif, Lam, Mim."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This is the Book, there is no doubt in it, a guidance to the Godwary,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="who believe in the Unseen, maintain the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="and who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and are certain of the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="5" text="Those follow their Lord’s guidance and it is they who are the felicitous."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for the faithless, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not have faith."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Allah has set a seal on their hearts and their hearing, and there is a blindfold on their sight, and there is a great punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Among the people are those who say, ‘We have faith in Allah and the Last Day,’ but they have no faith."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They seek to deceive Allah and those who have faith, yet they deceive no one but themselves, but they are not aware."/>
		<aya index="10" text="There is a sickness in their hearts; then Allah increased their sickness, and there is a painful punishment for them because of the lies they used to tell."/>
		<aya index="11" text="When they are told, ‘Do not cause corruption on the earth,’ they say, ‘We are only reformers!’"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Behold! They are themselves the agents of corruption, but they are not aware."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And when they are told, ‘Believe like the people who have believed,’ they say, ‘Shall we believe like the fools who have believed?’ Behold! They are themselves the fools, but they do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet the faithful, they say, ‘We believe,’ but when they are alone with their devils, they say, ‘We are with you; we were only deriding [them].’"/>
		<aya index="15" text="It is Allah who derides them, and leaves them bewildered in their rebellion."/>
		<aya index="16" text="They are the ones who bought error for guidance, so their trade did not profit them, nor were they guided."/>
		<aya index="17" text="Their parable is that of one who lighted a torch, and when it had lit up all around him, Allah took away their light, and left them sightless in a manifold darkness."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not come back."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or that of a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and lightning: they put their fingers in their ears due to the thunderclaps, apprehensive of death; and Allah besieges the faithless."/>
		<aya index="20" text="The lightning almost snatches away their sight: whenever it shines for them, they walk in it, and when the darkness falls upon them, they stand. Had Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and sight. Indeed Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O mankind! Worship your Lord, who created you and those who were before you, so that you may be Godwary"/>
		<aya index="22" text="—He who made the earth a place of repose for you, and the sky a canopy, and He sends down water from the sky and with it brings forth crops for your sustenance. So do not set up equals to Allah, while you know."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And if you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a surah like it, and invoke your helpers besides Allah, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you do not—and you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel will be humans and stones, prepared for the faithless."/>
		<aya index="25" text="And give good news to those who have faith and do righteous deeds, that for them shall be gardens with streams running in them: whenever they are provided with their fruit for nourishment, they will say, ‘This is what we were provided before,’ and they were given something resembling it. There will be chaste mates for them, and they will remain therein [forever]."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Indeed Allah is not ashamed to draw a parable whether it is that of a gnat or something above it. As for those who have faith, they know it is the truth from their Lord; and as for the faithless, they say, ‘What did Allah mean by this parable?’ Thereby He leads many astray, and thereby He guides many; and He leads no one astray thereby except the transgressors"/>
		<aya index="27" text="—those who break the covenant made with Allah after having pledged it solemnly, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption on the earth—it is they who are the losers."/>
		<aya index="28" text="How can you be unfaithful to Allah, [seeing that] you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will make you die and then bring you to life, and then you will be brought back to Him?"/>
		<aya index="29" text="It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned to the heaven and fashioned it into seven heavens, and He has knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="30" text="When your Lord said to the angels, ‘Indeed I am going to set a viceroy on the earth,’ they said, ‘Will You set in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we celebrate Your praise and proclaim Your sanctity?’ He said, ‘Indeed I know what you do not know.’"/>
		<aya index="31" text="And He taught Adam the Names, all of them; then presented them to the angels and said, ‘Tell me the names of these, if you are truthful.’"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said, ‘Immaculate are You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed You are the All-knowing, the All-wise.’"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said, ‘O Adam, inform them of their names,’ and when he had informed them of their names, He said, ‘Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and that I know whatever you disclose and whatever you conceal?’"/>
		<aya index="34" text="And when We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they prostrated, but not Iblis: he refused and acted arrogantly, and he was one of the faithless."/>
		<aya index="35" text="We said, ‘O Adam, dwell with your mate in paradise and eat thereof freely whencesoever you wish, but do not approach this tree, lest you should be among the wrongdoers.’"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Then Satan caused them to stumble from it, and he dislodged them from what [state] they were in; and We said, ‘Get down, being enemies of one another! On the earth shall be your abode and sustenance for a time.’"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then Adam received certain words from his Lord, and He turned to him clemently. Indeed He is the All-clement, the All-merciful."/>
		<aya index="38" text="We said, ‘Get down from it, all together! Yet, should any guidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But those who are faithless and deny Our signs, they shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it [forever]."/>
		<aya index="40" text="O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant that I may fulfill your covenant, and be in awe of Me [alone]."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in that which I have sent down confirming that which is with you, and do not be the first ones to deny it, and do not sell My signs for a paltry gain, and be wary of Me [alone]."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And maintain the prayer, and give the zakat, and bow along with those who bow [in prayer]."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Will you bid others to piety and forget yourselves, while you recite the Book? Do you not exercise your reason?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="And take recourse in patience and prayer, and it is indeed hard except for the humble"/>
		<aya index="46" text="—those who are certain that they will encounter their Lord and that they will return to Him."/>
		<aya index="47" text="O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I gave you an advantage over all the nations."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Beware of the day when no soul will compensate for another, neither any intercession shall be accepted from it, nor any ransom shall be received from it, nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="49" text="[Remember] when We delivered you from Pharaoh’s clan who inflicted a terrible torment on you, and slaughtered your sons and spared your women, and in that there was a great test from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="And when We parted the sea with you, and We delivered you and drowned Pharaoh’s clan as you looked on."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights, you took up the Calf [for worship] in his absence, and you were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Then We excused you after that so that you might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="53" text="And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion so that you might be guided."/>
		<aya index="54" text="And [recall] when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people! You have indeed wronged yourselves by taking up the Calf [for worship]. Now turn penitently to your Maker, and slay [the guilty among] your folks. That will be better for you with your Maker.’ Then He turned to you clemently. Indeed, He is the All-clement, the All-merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="And when you said, ‘O Moses, we will not believe you until we see Allah visibly.’ Thereupon a thunderbolt seized you as you looked on."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Then We raised you up after your death so that you might give thanks."/>
		<aya index="57" text="We shaded you with clouds, and sent down to you manna and quails [saying]: ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you.’ And they did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong [only] themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And when We said, ‘Enter this town, and eat thereof freely whencesoever you wish, and enter while prostrating at the gate, and say, ‘‘Relieve [us of the burden of our sins],’’ so that We may forgive your iniquities and We will soon enhance the virtuous.’"/>
		<aya index="59" text="But the wrongdoers changed the saying with other than what they were told. So We sent down on those who were wrongdoers a plague from the sky because of the transgressions they used to commit."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, ‘Strike the rock with your staff.’ Thereat twelve fountains gushed forth from it; every tribe came to know its drinking-place. ‘Eat and drink of Allah’s provision, and do not act wickedly on the earth, causing corruption.’"/>
		<aya index="61" text="And when you said, ‘O Moses, ‘We will not put up with one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us, so that He may bring forth for us of that which the earth grows—its greens and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and onions.’ He said, ‘Do you seek to replace what is superior with that which is inferior? Go down to any town and you will indeed get what you ask for!’ So they were struck with abasement and poverty, and they earned Allah’s wrath. That, because they would deny the signs of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly. That, because they would disobey and commit transgressions."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Indeed the faithful, the Jews, the Christians and the Sabaeans—those of them who have faith in Allah and the Last Day and act righteously—they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve."/>
		<aya index="63" text="And when We took a pledge from you, and raised the Mount above you, [declaring], ‘Hold on with power to what We have given you and remember that which is in it so that you may be Godwary.’"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Again you turned away after that; and were it not for Allah’s grace on you and His mercy, you would have surely been among the losers."/>
		<aya index="65" text="And certainly you know those of you who violated the Sabbath, whereupon We said to them, ‘Be you spurned apes.’"/>
		<aya index="66" text="So We made it an exemplary punishment for the present and the succeeding [generations], and an advice to the Godwary."/>
		<aya index="67" text="And when Moses said to his people, ‘Allah commands you to slaughter a cow,’ they said, ‘Are you mocking us?’ He said, ‘I seek Allah’s protection lest I should be one of the ignorant!’"/>
		<aya index="68" text="They said, ‘Invoke your Lord for us that He may clarify for us what she may be.’ He said, ‘He says, she is a cow, neither old nor young, of a middle age. Now do what you are commanded.’"/>
		<aya index="69" text="They said, ‘Invoke your Lord for us that He may clarify for us what her colour may be.’ He said, ‘He says, she is a cow that is yellow, of a bright hue, pleasing to the onlookers.’"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said, ‘Invoke your Lord for us that He may clarify for us what she may be. Indeed all cows are much alike to us, and if Allah wishes we will surely be guided.’"/>
		<aya index="71" text="He said, ‘He says, She is a cow not broken to till the earth or water the tillage, sound and without blemish.’ They said, ‘Now have you come up with the truth!’ And they slaughtered it, though they were about not to do it."/>
		<aya index="72" text="And when you killed a soul, and accused one another about it—and Allah was to expose what you were concealing—"/>
		<aya index="73" text="We said, ‘Strike him with a piece of it:’ thus does Allah revive the dead, and He shows you His signs so that you may exercise your reason."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Then your hearts hardened after that; so they are like stones, or even harder. For there are some stones from which streams gush forth, and there are some of them that split, and water issues from them, and there are some that fall for the fear of Allah. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Are you then eager that they should believe you, though a part of them would hear the word of Allah and then they would distort it after they had understood it, and they knew [what they were doing]?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="When they meet the faithful, they say, ‘We believe,’ and when they are alone with one another, they say, ‘Do you recount to them what Allah has revealed to you, so that they may argue with you therewith before your Lord? Do you not exercise your reason?’"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they not know that Allah knows whatever they hide and whatever they disclose?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="And among them are the illiterate who know nothing of the Book except hearsay, and they only make conjectures."/>
		<aya index="79" text="So woe to them who write the Book with their hands and then say, ‘This is from Allah,’ that they may sell it for a paltry gain. So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn!"/>
		<aya index="80" text="And they say, ‘The Fire shall not touch us except for a number of days.’ Say, ‘Have you taken a promise from Allah? If so, Allah will never break His promise. Do you ascribe to Allah what you do not know?’"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Certainly whoever commits misdeeds and is besieged by his iniquity—such shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they will remain in it [forever]."/>
		<aya index="82" text="And those who have faith and do righteous deeds—they shall be the inhabitants of paradise; they will remain in it [forever]."/>
		<aya index="83" text="When We took a pledge from the Children of Israel, [saying]: ‘Worship no one but Allah, do good to your parents, relatives, orphans, and the needy, speak kindly to people, maintain the prayer, and give the zakat,’ you turned away, except a few of you, and you were disregardful."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And when We took a pledge from you, [saying]: ‘You shall not shed your [own people’s] blood, and you shall not expel your folks from your homes,’ you pledged, and you testify [to this pledge of your ancestors]."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Then there you were, killing your folks and expelling a part of your folks from their homes, backing one another against them in sin and aggression! And if they came to you as captives, you would ransom them, though their expulsion itself was forbidden you. What! Do you believe in part of the Book and deny another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="They are the ones who bought the life of this world for the Hereafter; so their punishment shall not be lightened, nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Certainly, We gave Moses the Book and followed him with the apostles, and We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, manifest proofs and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit. Is it not that whenever an apostle brought you that which was not to your liking, you would act arrogantly; so you would impugn a group [of them], and slay a[nother] group?"/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say, ‘Our hearts are uncircumcised.’ Rather, Allah has cursed them for their unfaith, so few of them have faith."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming that which is with them—and earlier they would pray for victory over the pagans—so when there came to them what they recognized, they denied it. So may the curse of Allah be on the faithless!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Evil is that for which they have sold their souls, by defying what Allah has sent down, out of envy that Allah should bestow His grace on any of His servants that He wishes. Thus, they earned wrath upon wrath, and there is a humiliating punishment for the faithless."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when they are told, ‘Believe in what Allah has sent down,’ they say, ‘We believe in what was sent down to us,’ and they disbelieve what is besides it, though it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say, ‘Then why would you kill the prophets of Allah formerly, should you be faithful?’"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Certainly Moses brought you manifest proofs, but then you took up the Calf in his absence and you were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="93" text="And when We took covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, [declaring], ‘Hold on with power to what We have given you, and do listen!’ They said, ‘We hear, and disobey,’ and their hearts had been imbued with [the love of] the Calf, due to their unfaith. Say, ‘Evil is that to which your faith prompts you, should you be faithful!’"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Say, ‘If the abode of the Hereafter were exclusively for you with Allah, and not for other people, then long for death, should you be truthful.’"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will not long for it ever because of what their hands have sent ahead, and Allah knows best the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Surely, you will find them the greediest for life, of all people even the idolaters. Each of them is eager to live a thousand years, though it would not deliver him from the punishment, were he to live [that long]. And Allah watches what they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say, ‘Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel [should know that] it is he who has brought it down on your heart with the will of Allah, confirming what has been [revealed] before it and as a guidance and good news for the faithful.’"/>
		<aya index="98" text="[Say,] ‘Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His angels and His apostles and Gabriel and Michael, [let him know that] Allah is the enemy of the faithless.’"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We have certainly sent down manifest signs to you, and no one denies them except transgressors."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Is it not that whenever they made a covenant, a part of them would cast it away? Rather, the majority of them do not have faith."/>
		<aya index="101" text="And when there came to them an apostle from Allah, confirming that which is with them, a part of those who were given the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their back, as if they did not know [that it is Allah’s Book]."/>
		<aya index="102" text="And they followed what the devils pursued during Solomon’s reign —and Solomon was not faithless but it was the devils who were faithless—teaching the people magic and what was sent down to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut, who would not teach anyone without telling [him], ‘We are only a test, so do not be faithless.’ But they would learn from those two that with which they would cause a split between man and his wife—though they could not harm anyone with it except with Allah’s leave. They would learn that which would harm them and bring them no benefit; though they certainly knew that anyone who buys it has no share in the Hereafter. Surely, evil is that for which they sold their souls, had they known!"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Had they been faithful and Godwary, the reward from Allah would have been better, had they known!"/>
		<aya index="104" text="O you who have faith! Do not say Ra‘ina, but say Unzurna, and listen! And there is a painful punishment for the faithless."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Neither the faithless from among the People of the Book nor the idolaters like that any good be showered on you from your Lord; but Allah singles out for His mercy whomever He wishes, and Allah is dispenser of a mighty grace."/>
		<aya index="106" text="For any verse that We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring another which is better than it, or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? And besides Allah, you do not have any guardian or helper."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Would you question your Apostle as Moses was questioned formerly? Whoever changes faith for unfaith certainly strays from the right way."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Many of the People of the Book are eager to turn you into unbelievers after your faith, out of their inner envy, [and] after the truth had become manifest to them. Yet excuse [them] and forbear until Allah issues His edict. Indeed Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="And maintain the prayer and give the zakat. Any good that you send ahead for your own souls, you shall find it with Allah. Indeed Allah watches what you do."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say, ‘No one will enter paradise except one who is a Jew or Christian.’ Those are their [false] hopes! Say, ‘Produce your evidence, should you be truthful.’"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Certainly, whoever submits his will to Allah and is virtuous, he shall have his reward from his Lord, and they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say, ‘The Christians stand on nothing,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Jews stand on nothing,’ though they follow the [same] Book. So said those who had no knowledge, [words] similar to what they say. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that about which they used to differ."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Who is a greater wrongdoer than those who deny access to the mosques of Allah lest His Name be celebrated therein, and try to ruin them? Such ones may not enter them, except in fear. There is disgrace for them in this world and a great punishment in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="115" text="To Allah belong the east and the west: so whichever way you turn, there is the face of Allah! Allah is indeed all-bounteous, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="And they say, ‘Allah has taken a son.’ Immaculate is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever there is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him,"/>
		<aya index="117" text="the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decides on a matter, He just says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Those who have no knowledge say, ‘Why does not Allah speak to us, or come to us a sign?’ So said those who were before them, [words] similar to what they say. Alike are their hearts. We have certainly made the signs clear for a people who have certainty."/>
		<aya index="119" text="Indeed We have sent you with the truth, as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and you will not be questioned concerning the inmates of hell."/>
		<aya index="120" text="Never will the Jews be pleased with you, nor the Christians, unless you followed their creed. Say, ‘Indeed it is the guidance of Allah which is [true] guidance.’ And should you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you will not have against Allah any guardian or helper."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those to whom We have given the Book follow it as it ought to be followed: they have faith in it. As for those who deny it—it is they who are the losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I gave you an advantage over all the nations."/>
		<aya index="123" text="Beware of the Day when no soul will compensate for another, neither will any ransom be accepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be helped."/>
		<aya index="124" text="When his Lord tested Abraham with certain words and he fulfilled them, He said, ‘I am making you the Imam of mankind.’ Said he, ‘And from among my descendants?’ He said, ‘My pledge does not extend to the unjust.’"/>
		<aya index="125" text="And [remember] when We made the House a place of reward for mankind and a sanctuary, [declaring], ‘Take the venue of prayer from Abraham’s Station.’ We charged Abraham and Ishmael [with its upkeep, saying], ‘Purify My House for those who go around it, [for] those who make it a retreat and [for] those who bow and prostrate.’"/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, make this a secure town, and provide its people with fruits—such of them as have faith in Allah and the Last Day,’ He said, ‘As for him who is faithless, I will provide for him [too] for a short time, then I will shove him toward the punishment of the Fire and it is an evil destination.’"/>
		<aya index="127" text="As Abraham raised the foundations of the House with Ishmael, [they prayed]: ‘Our Lord, accept it from us! Indeed You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing."/>
		<aya index="128" text="‘Our Lord, make us submissive to You, and [raise] from our progeny a nation submissive to You, and show us our rites [of worship], and turn to us clemently. Indeed You are the All-clement, the All-merciful.’"/>
		<aya index="129" text="‘Our Lord, raise amongst them an apostle from among them, who will recite to them Your signs and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed You are the All-mighty, the All-wise.’"/>
		<aya index="130" text="And who will [ever] forsake Abraham’s creed except one who debases himself? We certainly chose him in the [present] world, and in the Hereafter he will indeed be among the Righteous."/>
		<aya index="131" text="When his Lord said to him, ‘Submit,’ he said, ‘I submit to the Lord of all the worlds.’"/>
		<aya index="132" text="Abraham enjoined this [creed] upon his children, and [so did] Jacob, [saying], ‘My children! Allah has indeed chosen this religion for you; so do not die except as those who have surrendered themselves [to Allah]."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his children, ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said, ‘We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, the One God, and to Him do we submit.’"/>
		<aya index="134" text="That was a nation that has passed: for it there will be what it has earned, and for you there will be what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="135" text="They say, ‘Be either Jews or Christians, that you may be [rightly] guided.’ Say, ‘No, rather, [we will follow] the creed of Abraham, a Hanif, and he was not one of the polytheists.’"/>
		<aya index="136" text="Say, ‘We have faith in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus were given, and that which the prophets were given from their Lord; we make no distinction between any of them and to Him do we submit.’"/>
		<aya index="137" text="So if they believe in the like of what you believe in, then they are surely guided; but if they turn away, then [know that] they are only [steeped] in defiance. Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing."/>
		<aya index="138" text="‘The baptism of Allah, and who baptizes better than Allah? And Him do we worship.’"/>
		<aya index="139" text="Say, ‘Will you argue with us concerning Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord, and to us belong our deeds, and to you belong your deeds, and we worship Him dedicatedly?’"/>
		<aya index="140" text="[Ask them,] ‘Do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians?’ Say, ‘Is it you who know better, or Allah?’ And who is a greater wrongdoer than someone who conceals a testimony that is with him from Allah?

		<aya index="256" text="There is no compulsion in religion: rectitude has become distinct from error. So one who disavows fake deities and has faith in Allah has held fast to the firmest handle for which there is no breaking; and Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="257" text="Allah is the wali of the faithful: He brings them out of darkness into light. As for the faithless, their awliya are the fake deities, who drive them out of light into darkness. They shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they will remain in it [forever]."/>
		<aya index="258" text="Have you not regarded him who argued with Abraham about his Lord, [only] because Allah had given him kingdom? When Abraham said, ‘My Lord is He who gives life and brings death,’ he replied, ‘I [too] give life and bring death.’ Abraham said, ‘Indeed Allah brings the sun from the east; now you bring it from the west.’ Thereat the faithless one was dumbfounded. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot."/>
		<aya index="259" text="Or him who came upon a township as it lay fallen on its trellises. He said, ‘How will Allah revive this after its death?!’ So Allah made him die for a hundred years, then He resurrected him. He said, ‘How long did you remain?’ Said he, ‘I have remained a day or part of a day.’ He said, ‘No, you have remained a hundred years. Now look at your food and drink which have not rotted! Then look at your ass! [This was done] that We may make you a sign for mankind. And now look at its bones, how We raise them up and clothe them with flesh!’ When it became evident to him, he said, ‘I know that Allah has power over all things.’"/>
		<aya index="260" text="And when Abraham said, ‘My Lord! Show me how You revive the dead,’ He said, ‘Do you not believe?’ He said, ‘Yes indeed, but in order that my heart may be at rest.’ He said, ‘Catch four of the birds. Then cut them into pieces, and place a part of them on every mountain, then call them; they will come to you hastening. And know that Allah is all-mighty and all-wise.’"/>
		<aya index="261" text="The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is that of a grain which grows seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains. Allah enhances severalfold whomever He wishes, and Allah is all-bounteous, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="262" text="Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reproaches and affronts, they shall have their reward near their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve."/>
		<aya index="263" text="An honourable reply [in response to the needy] and forgiving [their annoyance] is better than a charity followed by affront. Allah is all-sufficient, most forbearing."/>
		<aya index="264" text="O you who have faith! Do not render your charities void by reproaches and affronts, like those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and have no faith in Allah and the Last Day. Their parable is that of a rock covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, leaving it bare. They have no power over anything of what they have earned, and Allah does not guide the faithless lot."/>
		<aya index="265" text="The parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah’s pleasure and to confirm themselves [in their faith], is that of a garden on a hillside: the downpour strikes it, whereupon it brings forth its fruit twofold; and if it is not a downpour that strikes it, then a shower, and Allah watches what you do."/>
		<aya index="266" text="Would any of you like to have a garden of palm trees and vines, with streams running in it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein, and old age were to strike him while he has weakly offspring; whereupon a fiery hurricane were to hit it, whereat it lies burnt? Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may reflect."/>
		<aya index="267" text="O you who have faith! Spend of the good things you have earned [through trade and the like] and of what We bring forth for you from the earth, and do not be of the mind to give the bad part of it, for you yourselves would not take it, unless you ignore. And know that Allah is all-sufficient, all-laudable."/>
		<aya index="268" text="Satan frightens you of poverty and prompts you to [commit] indecent acts. But Allah promises you His forgiveness and bounty, and Allah is all-bounteous, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="269" text="He grants wisdom to whomever He wishes, and he, who is given wisdom, is certainly given an abundant good, and none takes admonition except those who possess intellect."/>
		<aya index="270" text="Allah indeed knows whatever charity you may give, or vows that you may vow, and the wrongdoers have no helpers."/>
		<aya index="271" text="If you disclose your charities, that is well, but if you hide them and give them to the poor, that is better for you, and it will atone for some of your misdeeds, and Allah is well aware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="272" text="It is not up to you to guide them; rather, it is Allah who guides whomever He wishes. Whatever wealth you spend, it is for your own benefit, as you do not spend but to seek Allah’s pleasure, and whatever wealth you spend will be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="273" text="[The charities are] for the poor who are straitened in the way of Allah, not capable of moving about in the land [for trade]. The unaware suppose them to be well-off because of their reserve. You recognize them by their mark; they do not ask the people importunately. And whatever wealth you may spend, Allah indeed knows it."/>
		<aya index="274" text="Those who give their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly, they shall have their reward near their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve."/>
		<aya index="275" text="Those who exact usury will not stand but like one deranged by the Devil’s touch. That is because they say, ‘Trade is just like usury.’ While Allah has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever relinquishes [usury] on receiving advice from his Lord shall keep [the gains of] what is past, and his matter will rest with Allah. As for those who resume, they shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it [forever]."/>
		<aya index="276" text="Allah brings usury to naught, but He makes charities flourish. Allah does not like any sinful ingrate."/>
		<aya index="277" text="Indeed those who have faith, do righteous deeds, maintain the prayer and give the zakat, they shall have their reward near their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve."/>
		<aya index="278" text="O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah and abandon [all claims to] what remains of usury, should you be faithful."/>
		<aya index="279" text="And if you do not, then be informed of a war from Allah and His apostle. And if you repent, then you will have your principal, neither harming others, nor suffering harm."/>
		<aya index="280" text="If [the debtor] is in straits, let there be a respite until the time of ease; and if you remit [the debt] as charity, it will be better for you, should you know."/>
		<aya index="281" text="And beware of a day in which you will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul shall be recompensed fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="282" text="O you who have faith! When you contract a loan for a specified term, write it down. Let a writer write with honesty between you, and let not the writer refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write, and let the one who incurs the debt dictate, and let him be wary of Allah, his Lord, and not diminish anything from it. But if the debtor be feeble-minded, or weak, or incapable of dictating himself, then let his guardian dictate with honesty, and take as witness two witnesses from your men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women—from those whom you approve as witnesses—so that if one of the two defaults the other will remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are called, and do not consider it wearisome to write it down, whether it be a big or small sum, [as a loan lent] until its term. That is more just with Allah and more upright in respect to testimony, and the likeliest way to avoid doubt, unless it is an on-the-spot deal you transact between yourselves, in which case there is no sin upon you not to write it. Take witnesses when you make a deal, and let no harm be done to the writer or witness, and if you did that, it would be sinful of you. Be wary of Allah and Allah will teach you, and Allah has knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="283" text="If you are on a journey and cannot find a writer, then a retained pledge [shall suffice]. And if one of you entrusts [an asset] to another, let him who is trusted deliver his trust, and let him be wary of Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal your testimony; anyone who conceals it, his heart will indeed be sinful, and Allah knows well what you do."/>
		<aya index="284" text="To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose what is in your hearts or hide it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whomever He wishes and punish whomever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="285" text="The Apostle and the faithful have faith in what has been sent down to him from his Lord. Each [of them] has faith in Allah, His angels, His scriptures and His apostles. [They declare,] ‘We make no distinction between any of His apostles.’ And they say, ‘We hear and obey. Our Lord, forgive us, and toward You is the return.’"/>
		<aya index="286" text="Allah does not task any soul beyond its capacity. Whatever [good] it earns is to its own benefit, and whatever [evil] it incurs is to its own harm. ‘Our Lord! Take us not to task if we forget or make mistakes! Our Lord! Do not place upon us a burden as You placed on those who were before us! Our Lord! Do not lay upon us what we have no strength to bear! Excuse us, forgive us, and be merciful to us! You are our Master, so help us against the faithless lot!’"/>

The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only an apostle of Allah, and His Word that He cast toward Mary and a spirit from Him. So have faith in Allah and His apostles, and do not say, ‘[God is] a trinity.’ Relinquish [such a creed]! That is better for you. Allah is but the One God. He is far too immaculate to have any son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and Allah suffices as trustee."/>
		<aya index="172" text="The Messiah would never disdain being a servant of Allah, nor would the angels brought near [to Him]. And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant, He will gather them all toward Him."/>
		<aya index="173" text="As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, He will pay them in full their rewards, and He will enhance them out of His grace. But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find besides Allah any guardian or helper."/>
		<aya index="174" text="O mankind! Certainly, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a manifest light."/>
		<aya index="175" text="As for those who have faith in Allah, and hold fast to Him, He will admit them to His mercy and grace, and He will guide them on a straight path to Him."/>
		<aya index="176" text="They ask you for a ruling. Say, ‘Allah gives you a ruling concerning the kalalah: If a man dies and has no children [or parents], but has a sister, for her shall be a half of what he leaves, and he shall inherit from her if she has no children. If there be two sisters, then they shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves. But if there be [several] brothers and sisters, then for the male shall be the like of the share of two females. Allah explains [the laws] for you lest you should go astray, and Allah has knowledge of all things.’"/>

	<sura index="5" name="المائدة">
		<aya index="1" text="O you who have faith! Keep your agreements. You are permitted animals of grazing livestock, except what is [now] announced to you, disallowing game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. Indeed Allah decrees whatever He desires."/>
		<aya index="2" text="O you who have faith! Do not violate Allah’s sacraments, neither the sacred month, nor the offering, nor the necklaces, nor those bound for the Sacred House, who seek their Lord’s grace and [His] pleasure. But when you emerge from pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt for game. Ill feeling for a people should not lead you, because they barred you from [access to] the Sacred Mosque, to transgress. Cooperate in piety and Godwariness, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression, and be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is severe in retribution."/>
		<aya index="3" text="You are prohibited carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been offered to other than Allah, and the animal strangled or beaten to death, and that which dies by falling or is gored to death, and that which is mangled by a beast of prey—barring that which you may purify —and what is sacrificed on stone altars [to idols], and that you should divide by raffling with arrows. All that is transgression. Today the faithless have despaired of your religion. So do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam as your religion. But should anyone be compelled by hunger, without inclining to sin, then Allah is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="4" text="They ask you as to what is lawful to them. Say, ‘All the good things are lawful to you.’ As for what you have taught hunting dogs [to catch], teaching them out of what Allah has taught you, eat of what they catch for you and mention Allah’s Name over it, and be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is swift at reckoning."/>
		<aya index="5" text="Today all the good things have been made lawful to you—the food of those who were given the Book is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them—and the chaste ones from among faithful women, and chaste women of those who were given the Book before you, when you have given them their dowries, in wedlock, not in license, nor taking paramours. Should anyone renounce his faith, his work shall fail and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="6" text="O you who have faith! When you stand up for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe a part of your heads and your feet, up to the ankles. If you are junub, purify yourselves. But if you are sick, or on a journey, or any of you has come from the toilet, or you have touched women, and you cannot find water, then make tayammum with clean ground and wipe a part of your faces and your hands with it. Allah does not desire to put you to hardship, but He desires to purify you, and to complete His blessing upon you so that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Remember Allah’s blessing upon you and His covenant with which He has bound you when you said, ‘We hear and obey.’ And be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah knows best what is in the breasts."/>
		<aya index="8" text="O you who have faith! Be maintainers, as witnesses for the sake of Allah, of justice, and ill feeling for a people should never lead you to be unfair. Be fair; that is nearer to Godwariness, and be wary of Allah. Allah is indeed well aware of what you do."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Allah has promised those who have faith and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward."/>
		<aya index="10" text="As for those who are faithless and deny Our signs, they shall be the inmates of hell."/>
		<aya index="11" text="O you who have faith! Remember Allah’s blessing upon you when a people set out to extend their hands against you, but He withheld their hands from you, and be wary of Allah, and in Allah let all the faithful put their trust."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Certainly Allah took a pledge from the Children of Israel, and We raised among them twelve chiefs. And Allah said, ‘I am with you! Surely, if you maintain the prayer and give the zakat and have faith in My apostles and support them and lend Allah a good loan, I will surely absolve you of your misdeeds, and I will surely admit you into gardens with streams running in them. But whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the right way.’"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Then, because of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard: they pervert words from their meanings, and have forgotten a part of what they were reminded. You will not cease to learn of some of their treachery, excepting a few of them. Yet excuse them and forbear. Indeed Allah loves the virtuous."/>
		<aya index="14" text="Also from those who say, ‘We are Christians,’ We took their pledge; but they forgot a part of what they were reminded. So We stirred up enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection, and soon Allah will inform them concerning what they had been doing."/>
		<aya index="15" text="O People of the Book! Certainly Our Apostle has come to you, clarifying for you much of what you used to hide of the Book, and excusing many [an offense of yours]. Certainly, there has come to you a light from Allah, and a manifest Book."/>
		<aya index="16" text="With it Allah guides those who follow [the course of] His pleasure to the ways of peace, and brings them out from darkness into light by His will, and guides them to a straight path."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They are certainly faithless who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.’ Say, ‘Who can avail anything against Allah should He wish to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and everyone upon the earth?’ To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them. He creates whatever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="18" text="The Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are Allah’s children and His beloved ones.’ Say, ‘Then why does He punish you for your sins?’ No, you are humans from among His creatures. He forgives whomever He wishes, and punishes whomever He wishes, and to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, and toward Him is the return."/>
		<aya index="19" text="O People of the Book! Certainly Our Apostle has come to you, clarifying [the Divine teachings] for you after a gap in [the appearance of] the apostles, lest you should say, ‘There did not come to us any bearer of good news nor any warner.’ Certainly, there has come to you a bearer of good news and a warner. And Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="20" text="When Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, remember Allah’s blessing upon you when He appointed prophets among you, and made you kings, and gave you what none of the nations were given."/>
		<aya index="21" text="O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has ordained for you, and do not turn your backs, or you will become losers.’"/>
		<aya index="22" text="They said, ‘O Moses, there are a tyrannical people in it. We will not enter it until they leave it. But once they leave it, we will go in.’"/>
		<aya index="23" text="Said two men from among those who were Godfearing and whom Allah had blessed: ‘Go at them by the gate! For once, you have entered it, you will be victors. Put your trust in Allah, should you be faithful.’"/>
		<aya index="24" text="They said, ‘O Moses, we will never enter it so long as they remain in it. Go ahead, you and your Lord, and fight! We will be sitting right here.’"/>
		<aya index="25" text="He said, ‘My Lord! I have no power over [anyone] except myself and my brother, so part us from the transgressing lot.’"/>
		<aya index="26" text="He said, ‘It shall be forbidden them for forty years: they shall wander about in the earth. So do not grieve for the transgressing lot.’"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Relate to them truly the account of Adam’s two sons. When the two of them offered an offering, it was accepted from one of them and not accepted from the other. [One of them] said, ‘Surely I will kill you.’ [The other one] said, ‘Allah accepts only from the Godwary."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Even if you extend your hand toward me to kill me, I will not extend my hand toward you to kill you. Indeed, I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="29" text="I desire that you earn [the burden of] my sin and your sin, to become one of the inmates of the Fire, and such is the requital of the wrongdoers.’"/>
		<aya index="30" text="So his soul prompted him to kill his brother, and he killed him, and thus became one of the losers."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Then Allah sent a crow, exploring in the ground, to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He said, ‘Woe to me! Am I unable to be [even] like this crow and bury my brother’s corpse?’ Thus he became regretful."/>
		<aya index="32" text="That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul, without [its being guilty of] manslaughter or corruption on the earth, is as though he had killed all mankind, and whoever saves a life is as though he had saved all mankind. Our apostles certainly brought them manifest signs, yet even after that, many of them commit excesses on the earth."/>
		<aya index="33" text="Indeed the requital of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle, and try to cause corruption on the earth, is that they shall be slain or crucified, or shall have their hands and feet cut off from opposite sides, or be banished from the land. That is a disgrace for them in this world, and in the Hereafter, there is a great punishment for them,"/>
		<aya index="34" text="excepting those who repent before you capture them, and know that Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="35" text="O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah, and seek the means of recourse to Him, and wage jihad in His way, so that you may be felicitous."/>
		<aya index="36" text="Indeed if the faithless possessed all that is on the earth, and as much of it besides, to redeem themselves with it from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them, and there is a painful punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="37" text="They would long to leave the Fire, but they shall never leave it, and there is a lasting punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="38" text="As for the thief, man or woman, cut off their hands as a requital for what they have earned. [That is] an exemplary punishment from Allah, and Allah is all-mighty, all-wise."/>
		<aya index="39" text="But whoever repents after his wrongdoing, and reforms, then Allah shall accept his repentance. Indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whomever He wishes, and forgives whomever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="41" text="O Apostle! Do not grieve for those who are active in [promoting] unfaith, such as those who say, ‘We believe’ with their mouths, but whose hearts have no faith, and the Jews who eavesdrop with the aim of [telling] lies [against you] and eavesdrop for other people who do not come to you. They pervert words from their meanings, [and] say, ‘If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, beware!’ Yet whomever Allah wishes to mislead, you cannot avail him anything against Allah. They are the ones whose hearts Allah did not desire to purify. For them is disgrace in this world, and there is a great punishment for them in the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Eavesdroppers with the aim of [telling] lies, eaters of the unlawful—if they come to you, judge between them, or disregard them. If you disregard them, they will not harm you in any way. But if you judge, judge between them with justice. Indeed Allah loves the just."/>
		<aya index="43" text="And how should they make you a judge, while with them is the Torah, in which is Allah’s judgement? Yet in spite of that, they turn their backs [on Him] and they are not believers."/>
		<aya index="44" text="We sent down the Torah containing guidance and light. The prophets, who had submitted, judged by it for the Jews, and so did the rabbis and the scribes, as they were charged to preserve the Book of Allah and were witnesses to it. So do not fear the people, but fear Me, and do not sell My signs for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down—it is they who are the faithless."/>
		<aya index="45" text="In it We prescribed for them: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and retaliation for wounds. Yet whoever remits it out of charity, that shall be an atonement for him. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down—it is they who are the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="46" text="We followed them with Jesus son of Mary, to confirm that which was before him of the Torah, and We gave him the Evangel containing guidance and light, confirming what was before it of the Torah, and as guidance and advice for the Godwary."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Let the people of the Evangel judge by what Allah has sent down in it. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down—it is they who are the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="48" text="We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming what was before it of the Book and as a guardian over it. So judge between them by what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires against the truth that has come to you. For each [community] among you We had appointed a code [of law] and a path, and had Allah wished He would have made you one community, but [His purposes required] that He should test you in respect to what He has given you. So take the lead in all good works. To Allah shall be the return of you all, whereat He will inform you concerning that about which you used to differ."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Judge between them by what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires. Beware of them lest they should beguile you from part of what Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn their backs [on you], then know that Allah desires to punish them for some of their sins, and indeed many of the people are transgressors."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Do they seek the judgement of [pagan] ignorance? But who is better than Allah in judgement for a people who have certainty?"/>
		<aya index="51" text="O you who have faith! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for allies: they are allies of each other. Any of you who allies with them is indeed one of them. Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Yet you see those in whose hearts is a sickness rushing to them, saying, ‘We fear lest a turn of fortune should visit us.’ Maybe Allah will bring about a victory, or a command from Him, and then they will be regretful for what they kept secret in their hearts,"/>
		<aya index="53" text="and the faithful will say, ‘Are these the ones who swore by Allah with solemn oaths that they were with you?!’ Their works have failed, and they have become losers."/>
		<aya index="54" text="O you who have faith! Should any of you desert his religion, Allah will soon bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, [who will be] humble towards the faithful, stern towards the faithless, waging jihad in the way of Allah, not fearing the blame of any blamer. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is all-bounteous, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Your guardian is only Allah, His Apostle, and the faithful who maintain the prayer and give the zakat while bowing down."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Whoever takes for his guardians Allah, His Apostle and the faithful [should know that] the confederates of Allah are indeed the victorious."/>
		<aya index="57" text="O you who have faith! Do not take those who take your religion in derision and play, from among those who were given the Book before you, and the infidels, as friends, and be wary of Allah, should you be faithful."/>
		<aya index="58" text="When you call to prayer, they take it in derision and play. That is because they are a people who do not exercise their reason."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Say, ‘O People of the Book! Are you vindictive toward us for any reason except that we have faith in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and in what was sent down before, and that most of you are transgressors?’"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Say, ‘Shall I inform you concerning something worse than that as a requital from Allah? Those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He is wrathful, and turned some of whom into apes and swine, and worshippers of fake deities! Such are in a worse situation and more astray from the right way.’"/>
		<aya index="61" text="When they come to you, they say, ‘We believe.’ Certainly, they enter with disbelief and leave with it, and Allah knows best as to what they have been concealing."/>
		<aya index="62" text="You see many of them actively engaged in sin and aggression, and consuming illicit gains. Surely, evil is what they have been doing."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Why do not the rabbis and the scribes forbid them from sinful speech and consuming illicit gains? Surely, evil is what they have been working."/>
		<aya index="64" text="The Jews say, ‘Allah’s hand is tied up.’ Tied up be their hands, and cursed be they for what they say! No, His hands are wide open: He bestows as He wishes. Surely many of them will be increased in rebellion and unfaith by what has been sent to you from your Lord, and We have cast enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they ignite the flames of war, Allah puts them out. They seek to cause corruption on the earth, and Allah does not like the agents of corruption."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Had the People of the Book believed and been Godwary, We would surely have absolved them of their misdeeds and admitted them into gardens of bliss."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Had they observed the Torah and the Evangel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have drawn nourishment from above them and from beneath their feet. There is an upright group among them, but evil is what many of them do."/>
		<aya index="67" text="O Apostle! Communicate that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not, you will not have communicated His message, and Allah shall protect you from the people. Indeed Allah does not guide the faithless lot."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Say, ‘O People of the Book! You do not stand on anything until you observe the Torah and the Evangel and what was sent down to you from your Lord.’ Surely many of them will be increased in rebellion and unfaith by what has been sent down to you from your Lord. So do not grieve for the faithless lot."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Indeed the faithful, the Jews, the Sabaeans, and the Christians—those who have faith in Allah and the Last Day and act righteously—they will have no fear, nor will they grieve."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Certainly We took a pledge from the Children of Israel, and We sent apostles to them. Whenever an apostle brought them that which was not to their liking, they would impugn a part of them, and a part they would slay."/>
		<aya index="71" text="They supposed there would be no testing, so they became blind and deaf. Thereafter Allah accepted their repentance, yet [again] many of them became blind and deaf, and Allah watches what they do."/>
		<aya index="72" text="They are certainly faithless who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.’ But the Messiah had said, ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord, and your Lord. Indeed whoever ascribes partners to Allah, Allah shall forbid him [entry into] paradise, and his refuge shall be the Fire, and the wrongdoers will not have any helpers.’"/>
		<aya index="73" text="They are certainly faithless who say, ‘Allah is the third [person] of a trinity,’ while there is no god except the One God. If they do not relinquish what they say, there shall befall the faithless among them a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Will they not repent to Allah and plead to Him for forgiveness? Yet Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="75" text="The Messiah, son of Mary, is but an apostle. Certainly, [other] apostles have passed before him, and his mother was a truthful one. Both of them would eat food. Look how We clarify the signs for them, and yet, look, how they go astray!"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Say, ‘Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power to bring you any benefit or harm, while Allah—He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing?!’"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Say, ‘O People of the Book! Do not unduly exceed the bounds in your religion and do not follow the fancies of a people who went astray in the past, and led many astray, and [themselves] strayed from the right path.’"/>
		<aya index="78" text="The faithless among the Children of Israel were cursed on the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That, because they would disobey and they used to commit transgression."/>
		<aya index="79" text="They would not forbid one another from the wrongs that they committed. Surely, evil is what they had been doing."/>
		<aya index="80" text="You see many of them fraternizing with the faithless. Surely evil is what they have sent ahead for their souls, as Allah is displeased with them and they shall remain in punishment [forever]."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Had they believed in Allah and the Prophet and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken them for allies. But most of them are transgressors."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Surely You will find the most hostile of all people towards the faithful to be the Jews and the polytheists, and surely you will find the nearest of them in affection to the faithful to be those who say ‘We are Christians.’ That is because there are priests and monks among them, and because they are not arrogant."/>
		<aya index="83" text="When they hear what has been revealed to the Apostle, you see their eyes fill with tears because of the truth that they recognize. They say, ‘Our Lord, we believe; so write us down among the witnesses."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, eager as we are that our Lord should admit us among the righteous people?’"/>
		<aya index="85" text="So, for what they said, Allah requited them with gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], and that is the reward of the virtuous."/>
		<aya index="86" text="But those who are faithless and deny Our signs—they shall be the inmates of hell."/>
		<aya index="87" text="O you who have faith! Do not prohibit the good things that Allah has made lawful to you, and do not transgress. Indeed Allah does not like the transgressors."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Eat the lawful and good things Allah has provided you, and be wary of Allah in whom you have faith."/>
		<aya index="89" text="Allah shall not take you to task for what is frivolous in your oaths; but He shall take you to task for what you pledge in earnest. The atonement for it is to feed ten needy persons with the average food you give to your families, or their clothing, or the freeing of a slave. He who cannot afford [any of these] shall fast for three days. That is the atonement for your oaths when you vow. But keep your oaths. Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="90" text="O you who have faith! Indeed wine, gambling, idols, and the divining arrows are abominations of Satan’s doing, so avoid them, so that you may be felicitous."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Indeed Satan seeks to cast enmity and hatred among you through wine and gambling, and to hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you, then, relinquish?"/>
		<aya index="92" text="And obey Allah and obey the Apostle, and beware; but if you turn your backs, then know that Our Apostle’s duty is only to communicate in clear terms."/>
		<aya index="93" text="There will be no sin upon those who have faith and do righteous deeds in regard to what they have eaten [in the past] so long as they are Godwary and faithful and do righteous deeds, and are further Godwary and faithful, and are further Godwary and virtuous. And Allah loves the virtuous."/>
		<aya index="94" text="O you who have faith! Allah will surely test you with some of the game within the reach of your hands and spears, so that Allah may know those who fear Him in secret. So whoever transgresses after that, there is a painful punishment for him."/>
		<aya index="95" text="O you who have faith! Do not kill any game when you are in pilgrim sanctity. Should any of you kill it intentionally, its atonement, the counterpart from cattle of what he has killed, as judged by two fair men among you, will be an offering brought to the Ka‘bah, or an atonement by feeding needy persons, or its equivalent in fasting, that he may taste the untoward consequences of his conduct. Allah has excused what is already past; but should anyone resume, Allah shall take vengeance on him, for Allah is all-mighty, avenger."/>
		<aya index="96" text="You are permitted the game of the sea and its food, a provision for you and for the caravans, but you are forbidden the game of the land so long as you remain in pilgrim sanctity, and be wary of Allah toward whom you will be gathered."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Allah has made the Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, a [means of] sustentation for mankind, and [also] the sacred month, the offering and the garlands, so that you may know that Allah knows whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth, and that Allah has knowledge of all things."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and that Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="99" text="The Apostle’s duty is only to communicate and Allah knows whatever you disclose and whatever you conceal."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Say, ‘The good and the bad are not equal, though the abundance of the bad should amaze you.’ So be wary of Allah, O you who possess intellect, so that you may be felicitous!"/>
		<aya index="101" text="O you who have faith! Do not ask about things, which, if they are disclosed to you, will upset you. Yet if you ask about them while the Quran is being sent down, they shall be disclosed to you. Allah has excused it, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-forbearing."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Certainly some people asked about them before you and then came to disbelieve in them."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Allah has not prescribed any such thing as Bahirah, Sa’ibah, Waseelah, or Haam; but those who are faithless fabricate lies against Allah, and most of them do not exercise their reason."/>
		<aya index="104" text="When they are told, ‘Come to what Allah has sent down and [come] to the Apostle,’ they say, ‘Sufficient for us is what we have found our fathers following.’ What, even if their fathers did not know anything and were not guided?!"/>
		<aya index="105" text="O you who have faith! Take care of your own souls. He who strays cannot hurt you if you are guided. To Allah will be the return of you all, whereat He will inform you concerning what you used to do."/>
		<aya index="106" text="O you who have faith! The witness between you, when death approaches any of you, while making a bequest, shall be two fair men from among yourselves—or two from among others, if you are journeying in the land and the affliction of death visits you. You shall detain the two of them after the prayer, and, if you have any doubt, they shall vow by Allah, ‘We will not sell it for any gain, even if it were a relative, nor will we conceal the testimony of Allah, for then we would indeed be among the sinners.’"/>
		<aya index="107" text="But if it is found that both of them were guilty of a sin, then two others shall stand up in their place from among those nearest in kinship to the claimants and swear by Allah: ‘Our testimony is surely truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, for then we would indeed be among the wrongdoers.’"/>
		<aya index="108" text="That makes it likelier that they give the testimony in its genuine form, or fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. Be wary of Allah and listen, and Allah does not guide the transgressing lot."/>

		<aya index="132" text="For everyone there are ranks in accordance with what they have done; and your Lord is not oblivious of what they do."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Your Lord is the All-sufficient dispenser of mercy. If He wishes, He will take you away, and make whomever He wishes succeed you, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people."/>
		<aya index="134" text="Indeed what you are promised will surely come, and you will not be able to thwart it."/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say, ‘O my people, act according to your ability; I too am acting. Soon you will know in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be. Indeed the wrongdoers will not be felicitous.’"/>
		<aya index="136" text="They dedicate a portion to Allah out of what He has created of the crops and cattle, and say, ‘This is for Allah,’ so do they maintain, ‘and this is for our partners.’ But what is for their partners does not reach Allah, and what is for Allah reaches their partners. Evil is the judgement that they make."/>
		<aya index="137" text="That is how to most of the polytheists the slaying of their children is presented as decorous by those whom they ascribe as partners [to Allah], that they may ruin them and confound their religion for them. Had Allah wished, they would not have done it. So leave them with what they fabricate."/>
		<aya index="138" text="And they say, ‘These cattle and tillage are a taboo: none may eat them except whom we please,’ so they maintain, and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden and cattle over which they do not mention Allah’s Name, fabricating a lie against Him. Soon He will requite them for what they used to fabricate."/>
		<aya index="139" text="And they say, ‘That which is in the bellies of these cattle is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our wives. But if it be still-born, they will all share it.’ Soon He will requite them for their allegations. Indeed, He is all-wise, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="140" text="They are certainly losers who slay their children foolishly without knowledge, and forbid what Allah has provided them, fabricating a lie against Allah. Certainly, they have gone astray and are not guided."/>
		<aya index="141" text="It is He who produces gardens trellised and without trellises, and palm-trees and crops of diverse produce, olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruits when it fructifies, and give its due on the day of harvest, and do not be wasteful; indeed, He does not like the wasteful."/>
		<aya index="142" text="Of the cattle [some] are for burden and [some] for slaughter. Eat of what Allah has provided you and do not follow in Satan’s footsteps; he is indeed your manifest enemy."/>
		<aya index="143" text="Eight mates: two of sheep, and two of goats. Say, ‘Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females, or what is contained in the wombs of the two females? Inform me with knowledge, should you be truthful.’"/>
		<aya index="144" text="And two of camels and two of oxen. Say, ‘Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females, or what is contained in the wombs of the two females? Were you witnesses when Allah enjoined this upon you?’ So who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against Allah to mislead the people without any knowledge? Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot."/>
		<aya index="145" text="Say, ‘I do not find in what has been revealed to me that anyone be forbidden to eat anything except carrion or spilt blood, or the flesh of swine—for that is indeed unclean—or an impiety offered to other than Allah.’ But should someone be compelled, without being rebellious or aggressive, indeed your Lord is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="146" text="To the Jews We forbade every animal having an undivided hoof, and of oxen and sheep We forbade them their fat, except what is borne by their backs or the entrails, or what is attached to the bones. We requited them with that for their rebelliousness, and We indeed speak the truth."/>
		<aya index="147" text="But if they deny you, say, ‘Your Lord is dispenser of an all-embracing mercy, but His punishment will not be averted from the guilty lot.’"/>
		<aya index="148" text="The polytheists will say, ‘Had Allah wished we would not have ascribed any partner [to Him], nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything.’ Those who were before them had denied likewise until they tasted Our punishment. Say, ‘Do you have any [revealed] knowledge that you can produce before us? You follow nothing but conjectures, and you do nothing but surmise.’"/>
		<aya index="149" text="Say, ‘To Allah belongs the conclusive argument. Had He wished, He would have surely guided you all.’"/>
		<aya index="150" text="Say, ‘Bring your witnesses who may testify that Allah has forbidden this.’ So if they testify, do not testify with them, and do not follow the desires of those who deny Our signs, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter and equate [others] with their Lord."/>
		<aya index="151" text="Say, ‘Come, I will recount what your Lord has forbidden you. That you shall not ascribe any partners to Him, and you shall be good to the parents, you shall not kill your children due to penury—We will provide for you and for them—you shall not approach indecencies, the outward among them and the inward ones, and you shall not kill a soul [whose life] Allah has made inviolable, except with due cause. This is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may exercise your reason."/>
		<aya index="152" text="Do not approach the orphan’s property, except in the best [possible] manner, until he comes of age. And observe fully the measure and the balance with justice.’ We task no soul except according to its capacity. ‘And when you speak, be fair, even if it were a relative; and fulfill Allah’s covenant. This is what He enjoins upon you so that you may take admonition.’"/>
		<aya index="153" text="‘This indeed is my straight path, so follow it, and do not follow [other] ways, for they will separate you from His way. This is what He enjoins upon you so that you may be Godwary.’"/>
		<aya index="154" text="Then We gave Moses the Book, completing [Our blessing] on him who is virtuous, and as an elaboration of all things, and as a guidance and mercy, so that they may believe in the encounter with their Lord."/>
		<aya index="155" text="And this Book that We have sent down is a blessed one; so follow it, and be Godwary so that you may receive [His] mercy."/>
		<aya index="156" text="Lest you should say, ‘The Book was sent down only to two communities before us, and we were indeed unaware of their studies,’"/>
		<aya index="157" text="or [lest] you should say, ‘If the Book had been sent down to us, surely we would have been better-guided than them.’ There has already come to you a manifest proof from your Lord and a guidance and mercy. So who is a greater wrongdoer than him who denies the signs of Allah, and turns away from them? Soon We shall requite those who turn away from Our signs with a terrible punishment because of what they used to evade."/>
		<aya index="158" text="Do they not consider that the angels may come to them, or your Lord may come, or some of your Lord’s signs may come? The day when some of your Lord’s signs do come, faith shall not benefit any soul that had not believed beforehand and had not earned some goodness in its faith. Say, ‘Wait! We too are waiting!’"/>
		<aya index="159" text="Indeed those who split up their religion and became sects, you will not have anything to do with them. Their matter rests only with Allah; then He will inform them concerning what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="160" text="Whoever brings virtue shall receive [a reward] ten times its like; but whoever brings vice shall not be requited except with its like, and they will not be wronged."/>
		<aya index="161" text="Say, ‘Indeed my Lord has guided me to a straight path, the upright religion, the creed of Abraham, a Hanif, and he was not one of the polytheists.’"/>
		<aya index="162" text="Say, ‘Indeed my prayer and my worship, my life and my death are for the sake of Allah, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="163" text="He has no partner, and I have been commanded [to follow] this [creed], and I am the first of those who submit [to Allah].’"/>
		<aya index="164" text="Say, ‘Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all things?’ No soul does evil except against itself, and no bearer shall bear another’s burden; then to your Lord will be your return, whereat He will inform you concerning that about which you used to differ."/>
		<aya index="165" text="It is He who has made you successors on the earth, and raised some of you in rank above others so that He may test you in respect to what He has given you. Indeed your Lord is swift in retribution, and indeed, He is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>

		<aya index="77" text="They said, ‘If he has stolen [there is no wonder]; a brother of his had stolen before.’ Thereupon Joseph kept the matter to himself and he did not disclose it to them. He said, ‘You are in a worse state! And Allah knows best what you allege.’"/>

This is the fulfillment of my dream of long ago, which my Lord has made come true.

		<aya index="8" text="We do not send down the angels except with due reason, and then they will not be granted any respite."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Indeed We have sent down the Reminder, and indeed We will preserve it."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Certainly We sent [apostles] before you to former communities,"/>
		<aya index="11" text="and there did not come to them any apostle but that they used to deride him."/>
		<aya index="12" text="That is how We let it pass through the hearts of the guilty:"/>
		<aya index="13" text="they do not believe in it, and the precedent of the ancients has already passed."/>
		<aya index="14" text="Were We to open for them a gate of the sky, so that they could go on ascending through it,"/>
		<aya index="15" text="they would surely say, ‘Indeed a spell has been cast on our eyes; indeed, we are a bewitched lot.’"/>
		<aya index="16" text="Certainly We have appointed houses in the sky and adorned them for the onlookers,"/>
		<aya index="17" text="and We have guarded them from every outcast Satan,"/>
		<aya index="18" text="except someone who may eavesdrop, whereat there pursues him a manifest flame."/>
		<aya index="19" text="And We spread out the earth, and cast in it firm mountains, and We grew in it every kind of balanced thing,"/>

		<aya index="21" text="There is not a thing but that its sources are with Us, and We do not send it down except in a known measure."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And We send the fertilizing winds and send down water from the sky providing it for you to drink and you are not maintainers of its resources."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Indeed it is We who give life and bring death and We are the inheritors."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Certainly We know the predecessors among you and certainly We know the successors,"/>
		<aya index="25" text="and indeed it is your Lord who will resurrect them. Indeed, He is all-wise, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Certainly We created man out of a dry clay [drawn] from an aging mud,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="and We created the jinn earlier, out of a piercing fire."/>
		<aya index="28" text="When your Lord said to the angels, ‘Indeed I am going to create a human out of a dry clay [drawn] from an aging mud."/>
		<aya index="29" text="So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down in prostration before him.’"/>

		<aya index="33" text="Said he, ‘I will not prostrate before a human whom You have created out of a dry clay [drawn] from an aging mud.’"/>
		<aya index="34" text="He said, ‘Begone hence, for you are indeed an outcast,"/>

		<aya index="36" text="He said, ‘My Lord! Respite me till the day they will be resurrected.’"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Said He, ‘You are indeed among the reprieved"/>
		<aya index="38" text="until the day of the known time.’"/>
		<aya index="39" text="He said, ‘My Lord! As You have consigned me to perversity, I will surely glamorize [evil] for them on the earth, and I will surely pervert them, all"/>
		<aya index="40" text="except Your dedicated servants among them.’"/>
		<aya index="41" text="He said, ‘This is the path [leading] straight to Me."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Indeed, as for My servants you do not have any authority over them, except the perverse who follow you,"/>
		<aya index="43" text="and indeed hell is the tryst of them all."/>
		<aya index="44" text="It has seven gates, and to each gate belongs a separate portion of them.’"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Indeed the Godwary will be amid gardens and springs."/>
		<aya index="46" text="‘‘Enter it in peace and safety!’’"/>
		<aya index="47" text="We will remove whatever rancour there is in their breasts; [intimate like] brothers, [they will be reclining] on couches, facing one another."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Therein neither weariness shall touch them, nor will they [ever] be expelled from it."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Inform my servants that I am indeed the All-forgiving, the All-merciful,"/>
		<aya index="50" text="and that My punishment is a painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And inform them about the guests of Abraham,"/>
		<aya index="52" text="when they entered into his presence and said, ‘Peace!’ He said, ‘We are indeed afraid of you.’"/>
		<aya index="53" text="They said, ‘Do not be afraid. Indeed we give you the good news of a wise son.’"/>
		<aya index="54" text="He said, ‘Do you give me good news though old age has befallen me? What is the good news that you bring me?’"/>
		<aya index="55" text="They said, ‘We bring you good news in truth; so do not be despondent.’"/>
		<aya index="56" text="He said, ‘Who despairs of his Lord’s mercy except the astray?!’"/>
		<aya index="57" text="He said, ‘O messengers, what is now your errand?’"/>
		<aya index="58" text="They said, ‘We have been sent toward a guilty people,"/>
		<aya index="59" text="[who shall perish] except the family of Lot. We will indeed deliver all of them,"/>
		<aya index="60" text="except his wife, [who], We have ordained, will indeed be among those who remain behind.’"/>
		<aya index="61" text="So when the messengers came to Lot’s family,"/>
		<aya index="62" text="he said, ‘You are indeed strangers [to me].’"/>
		<aya index="63" text="They said, ‘Indeed, we bring you what they used to doubt."/>
		<aya index="64" text="We bring you the truth, and indeed, we speak truly."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Take your family in a watch of the night; and follow in their rear, and none of you should turn round, and proceed as you are bidden.’"/>
		<aya index="66" text="We apprised him of the matter that these will be rooted out by dawn."/>
		<aya index="67" text="The people of the city came, rejoicing."/>
		<aya index="68" text="He said, ‘These are indeed my guests. Do not bring dishonour on me."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Be wary of Allah and do not humiliate me.’"/>
		<aya index="70" text="They said, ‘Did we not forbid you from [defending ] strangers?’"/>
		<aya index="71" text="He said, ‘These are my daughters, [marry them] if you should do anything.’"/>
		<aya index="72" text="By your life, they were bewildered in their drunkenness."/>
		<aya index="73" text="So the Cry seized them at sunrise,"/>
		<aya index="74" text="and We made its topmost part its nethermost, and rained on them stones of shale."/>
		<aya index="75" text="There are indeed signs in that for the percipient."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Indeed it is on a standing road,"/>
		<aya index="77" text="and there is indeed a sign in that for the faithful."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Indeed the inhabitants of Aykah were [also] wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="79" text="So We took vengeance on them, and indeed the two of them are on an open highway."/>
		<aya index="80" text="Certainly the inhabitants of Hijr denied the apostles."/>
		<aya index="81" text="We had given them Our signs but they disregarded them."/>
		<aya index="82" text="They used to hew out dwellings from mountains feeling secure."/>
		<aya index="83" text="So the Cry seized them at dawn,"/>

		<aya index="85" text="We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them except with consummate wisdom, and indeed the Hour is bound to come. So forbear with a graceful forbearance."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Indeed your Lord is the All-creator, the All-knowing."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Certainly We have given you [the surah of] the seven oft-repeated verses and the great Quran."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Do not extend your glance toward what We have provided to certain groups of them, and do not grieve for them, and lower your wing to the faithful,"/>
		<aya index="89" text="and say, ‘I am indeed a manifest warner [of punishment from God],’"/>
		<aya index="90" text="like that We sent down upon those who split into bands,"/>
		<aya index="91" text="who represented the Quran as magic."/>
		<aya index="92" text="By your Lord, We will question them all"/>
		<aya index="93" text="concerning what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="94" text="So proclaim what you have been commanded, and turn away from the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="95" text="Indeed We will suffice you against the deriders"/>
		<aya index="96" text="—those who set up another deity besides Allah. Soon they will know!"/>
		<aya index="97" text="Certainly We know that you become upset because of what they say."/>
		<aya index="98" text="So celebrate the praise of your Lord and be among those who prostrate,"/>

		<aya index="1" text="Allah’s edict is coming! So do not seek to hasten it. Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]."/>
		<aya index="2" text="He sends down the angels with the spirit of His command to whomever He wishes of His servants: ‘Warn [the people] that there is no god except Me; so be wary of Me.’"/>
		<aya index="3" text="He created the heavens and the earth with consummate wisdom. He is above having any partners that they ascribe [to Him]."/>
		<aya index="4" text="He created man from a drop of [seminal] fluid, and, behold, he is an open contender!"/>
		<aya index="5" text="He created the cattle, in which there is warmth for you and [other] uses, and some of them you eat."/>
		<aya index="6" text="There is in them a beauty for you when you bring them home for rest and when you drive them forth to pasture."/>

		<aya index="9" text="With Allah rests guidance to the straight path, and some of the paths are devious, and had He wished He would have guided you all."/>
		<aya index="10" text="It is He who sends down water from the sky: from it you get your drink and with it are [sustained] the plants wherein you pasture your herds."/>
		<aya index="11" text="For you He makes the crops grow with it and olives, date palms, vines, and fruits of all kinds. There is indeed a sign in that for a people who reflect."/>
		<aya index="12" text="He disposed the night and the day for you, and the sun, the moon and the stars are disposed by His command. There are indeed signs in that for people who exercise their reason."/>
		<aya index="13" text="And [He disposed for your benefit] whatever He has created for you in the earth of diverse hues—there is indeed a sign in that for a people who take admonition."/>
		<aya index="14" text="It is He who disposed the sea [for your benefit] that you may eat from it fresh meat, and obtain from it ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships plowing through it, that you may seek His bounty and that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="15" text="He cast firm mountains in the earth lest it should shake with you, and [made] streams and ways, so that you may be guided"/>

		<aya index="17" text="Is He who creates like one who does not create? Will you not then take admonition?"/>
		<aya index="18" text="If you enumerate Allah’s blessings, you will not be able to count them. Indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful,"/>

		<aya index="22" text="Your God is the One God. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are in denial [of the truth], and they are arrogant."/>
		<aya index="23" text="Undoubtedly, Allah knows whatever they hide and whatever they disclose. Indeed, He does not like the arrogant."/>
		<aya index="24" text="When they are asked, ‘What is it that your Lord has sent down?’ They say, ‘Myths of the ancients,’"/>
		<aya index="25" text="[with the result] that they will bear the full weight of their own burden on the Day of Resurrection, along with part of the burden of those whom they mislead without any knowledge. Behold! Evil is what they bear!"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Those who were before them [had also] schemed. Then Allah came at their edifice from the foundations and the roof fell down upon them from above and the punishment overtook them whence they were not aware."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them, and say, ‘Where are My “partners” for whose sake you used to defy [Allah]?’ Those who were given knowledge will say, ‘Indeed today disgrace and distress pursue the faithless.’"/>

		<aya index="30" text="But those who were Godwary will be asked, ‘What is it that your Lord has sent down?’ They will say, ‘Good.’ For those who do good in this world there will be a good [reward], and the abode of the Hereafter is better, and the abode of the Godwary is surely excellent:"/>
		<aya index="31" text="the Gardens of Eden, which they will enter, with streams running in them. There they will have whatever they wish, and thus does Allah reward the Godwary"/>
		<aya index="32" text="—those whom the angels take away while they are pure. They say [to them], ‘Peace be to you! Enter paradise because of what you used to do.’"/>

		<aya index="34" text="So the evils of what they had earned visited them, and they were besieged by what they used to deride."/>
		<aya index="35" text="The polytheists say, ‘Had Allah wished, we would not have worshiped anything besides Him—neither we, nor our fathers—nor we would have forbidden anything without His sanction.’ Those who were before them had acted likewise. Is the apostles’ duty anything but to communicate in clear terms?"/>
		<aya index="36" text="Certainly We raised an apostle in every nation [to preach:] ‘Worship Allah, and shun fake deities.’ Among them were some whom Allah guided, and among them were some who deserved to be in error. So travel over the land and observe how was the fate of the deniers."/>

		<aya index="46" text="Or that He will not seize them in the midst of their bustle, whereupon they will not be able to frustrate [Him]?"/>
		<aya index="47" text="Or that He will not visit them with attrition? Indeed your Lord is most kind and merciful."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Have they not regarded that whatever thing Allah has created casts its shadow to the right and to the left, prostrating to Allah in utter humility?"/>
		<aya index="49" text="To Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, including animals and angels, and they are not arrogant."/>
		<aya index="50" text="They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are commanded."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Allah has said, ‘Do not worship two gods. Indeed He is the One God, so be in awe of Me [alone].’"/>
		<aya index="52" text="To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him belongs the enduring religion. Will you, then, be wary of other than Allah?"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Whatever blessing you have is from Allah, and when a distress befalls you, you make entreaties to Him."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Then, when He removes the distress from you—behold, a part of them ascribe partners to their Lord,"/>
		<aya index="55" text="being unthankful for what We have given them. So let them enjoy. Soon they shall know!"/>
		<aya index="56" text="They assign a share in what We have provided them to what they do not know. By Allah, you will surely be questioned concerning what you used to fabricate."/>
		<aya index="57" text="And they attribute daughters to Allah—immaculate is He—while they will have what they desire!"/>
		<aya index="58" text="When one of them is brought the news of a female [newborn], his face becomes darkened, and he chokes with suppressed agony."/>
		<aya index="59" text="He hides from the people out of distress at the news he has been brought: shall he retain it in humiliation, or bury it in the ground! Behold! Evil is the judgement that they make."/>
		<aya index="60" text="There is an evil description for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and the loftiest description belongs to Allah, and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Were Allah to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing, He would not leave any living being upon it. But He respites them until a specified time; so when their time comes they shall not defer it by a single hour nor shall they advance it."/>
		<aya index="62" text="They attribute to Allah what they dislike [for themselves], and their tongues assert the lie that the best of rewards [in the Hereafter] will be theirs. Undoubtedly, the Fire shall be their lot and they will be foremost [in entering it]."/>
		<aya index="63" text="By Allah, We have certainly sent [apostles] to nations before you. But Satan made their deeds seem decorous to them. So he is their master today and there is a painful punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="64" text="We did not send down the Book to you except [for the purpose] that you may clarify for them what they differ about, and as a guidance and mercy for a people who have faith."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Allah sends down water from the sky with which He revives the earth after its death. There is indeed a sign in that for a people who listen."/>
		<aya index="66" text="There is indeed a lesson for you in the cattle: We give you a drink pleasant to those who drink, pure milk, which is in their bellies, between [intestinal] waste and blood."/>
		<aya index="67" text="From the fruits of date palms and vines you draw wine and goodly provision. There are indeed signs in that for people who exercise their reason."/>
		<aya index="68" text="And your Lord inspired the bee [saying]: ‘Make your home in the mountains, and on the trees and the trellises that they erect."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Then eat from every [kind of] fruit and follow meekly the ways of your Lord.’ There issues from its belly a juice of diverse hues, in which there is a cure for the people. There is indeed a sign in that for a people who reflect."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Allah has created you, then He takes you away, and there are some among you who are relegated to the nethermost age so that he knows nothing after [having possessed] some knowledge. Indeed Allah is all-knowing, all-powerful."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Allah has granted some of you an advantage over others in [respect of] provision. Those who have been granted an advantage do not give over their provision to their slaves so that they become equal in its respect. What, do they deny the blessing of Allah?"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Allah made for you mates from your own selves and appointed for you children and grandchildren from your mates, and We provided you with all the good things. What, do they believe in falsehood while they deny the blessing of Allah?"/>
		<aya index="73" text="They worship besides Allah what has no power to provide them with anything from the heavens and the earth, nor are they capable [of anything]."/>
		<aya index="74" text="So do not draw comparisons for Allah: indeed Allah knows and you do not know."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Allah draws a parable: a slave owned [by his master] who has no power over anything, and another one [a free man] whom We have provided a goodly provision and who spends out of it secretly and openly. Are they equal? All praise belongs to Allah. But most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Allah draws [another] parable: Two men, one of whom is dumb, having no power over anything and who is a liability to his master: wherever he directs him he does not bring any good. Is he equal to someone who enjoins justice and is [steady] on a straight path?"/>
		<aya index="77" text="To Allah belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. The matter of the Hour is just like the twinkling of an eye, or [even] swifter. Indeed Allah has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Allah has brought you forth from the bellies of your mothers while you did not know anything. He made for you hearing, eyesight, and hearts so that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Have they not regarded the birds disposed in the air of the sky: no one sustains them except Allah. There are indeed signs in that for a people who have faith."/>
		<aya index="80" text="It is Allah who has made your homes as a place of rest for you and He made for you homes out of the skins of the cattle which you find portable on the day of your shifting and on the day of your halt, and out of their wool, fur and hair [He has appointed] furniture and wares [enduring] for a while."/>
		<aya index="81" text="It is Allah who made for you the shade from what He has created, and made for you retreats in the mountains, and made for you garments that protect you from heat, and garments that protect you from your [mutual] violence. That is how He completes His blessing upon you so that you may submit [to Him]."/>
		<aya index="82" text="But if they turn their backs [on you], your duty is only to communicate in clear terms."/>
		<aya index="83" text="They recognize the blessing of Allah and then deny it, and most of them are faithless."/>
		<aya index="84" text="The day We shall raise a witness from every nation, the faithless will not be permitted [to speak], nor will they be asked to propitiate [Allah]."/>
		<aya index="85" text="And when the wrongdoers sight the punishment, it shall not be lightened for them, nor will they be granted any respite."/>
		<aya index="86" text="When the polytheists sight their partners, they will say, ‘Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to invoke besides You.’ But they will retort to them, ‘You are indeed liars!’"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They will submit to Allah on that day, and what they used to fabricate will forsake them."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Those who are faithless and bar from the way of Allah—We shall add punishment to their punishment because of the corruption they used to cause."/>
		<aya index="89" text="The day We raise in every nation a witness against them from among themselves, We shall bring you as a witness against these. We have sent down the Book to you as a clarification of all things and as guidance, mercy and good news for the Muslims."/>
		<aya index="90" text="Indeed Allah enjoins justice and kindness, and generosity towards relatives, and He forbids indecency, wrongdoing, and aggression. He advises you, so that you may take admonition."/>
		<aya index="91" text="Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you pledge, and do not break [your] oaths, after pledging them solemnly and having made Allah a witness over yourselves. Indeed Allah knows what you do."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Do not be like her who would undo her yarn, breaking it up after [spinning it to] strength, by making your oaths a means of [mutual] deceit among yourselves, so that one community may become more affluent than another community. Indeed Allah tests you thereby, and He will surely clarify for you on the Day of Resurrection what you used to differ about."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Had Allah wished, He would have made you one community, but He leads astray whomever He wishes and guides whomever He wishes, and you will surely be questioned concerning what you used to do."/>
		<aya index="94" text="Do not make your oaths a means of [mutual] deceit among yourselves, lest feet should stumble after being steady and [lest] you suffer ill for barring from the way of Allah and face a great punishment."/>
		<aya index="95" text="Do not sell Allah’s covenants for a paltry gain. Indeed, what is with Allah is better for you, should you know."/>
		<aya index="96" text="That which is with you will be spent [and gone], but what is with Allah shall last, and We will surely pay the patient their reward by the best of what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Whoever acts righteously, [whether] male or female, should he be faithful, We shall revive him with a good life and pay them their reward by the best of what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="98" text="When you recite the Quran, seek the protection of Allah against the outcast Satan."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Indeed he does not have any authority over those who have faith and put their trust in their Lord."/>
		<aya index="100" text="His authority is only over those who befriend him and those who make him a partner [of Allah]."/>
		<aya index="101" text="When We change a sign for another in its stead—and Allah knows best what He sends down—they say, ‘You are indeed a fabricator.’ Indeed, most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Say, the Holy Spirit has brought it down duly from your Lord to fortify those who have faith and as guidance and good news for the Muslims."/>
		<aya index="103" text="We certainly know that they say, ‘It is only a human that instructs him.’ The language of him to whom they refer is non-Arabic, while this is a clear Arabic language."/>
		<aya index="104" text="Indeed those who do not believe in the signs of Allah—Allah shall not guide them and there is a painful punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Only those fabricate lies who do not believe in the signs of Allah, and it is they who are the liars."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Excepting someone who is compelled [to recant his faith] while his heart is at rest in it, those who disbelieve in Allah after [affirming] their faith and open up their breasts to unfaith, Allah’s wrath shall be upon them and there is a great punishment for them."/>
		<aya index="107" text="That, because they preferred the life of the world to the Hereafter and that Allah does not guide the faithless lot."/>
		<aya index="108" text="They are the ones Allah has set a seal on their hearts, their hearing and their sight, and it is they who are the heedless."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Undoubtedly, they are the ones who will be the losers in the Hereafter."/>

		<aya index="115" text="He has forbidden you only carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been offered to other than Allah. But if someone is compelled [to eat any of that], without being rebellious or aggressive, indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>

		<aya index="89" text="We have certainly interspersed this Quran with every [kind of] parable for the people, but most people are only intent on ingratitude."/>
		<aya index="90" text="They say, ‘We will not believe you until you make a spring gush forth for us from the ground."/>

		<aya index="100" text="Say, ‘Even if you possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, you would withhold them for the fear of being spent, and man is very niggardly.’"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Certainly We gave Moses nine manifest signs. So ask the Children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, ‘O Moses, indeed I think you are bewitched.’"/>
		<aya index="102" text="He said, ‘You certainly know that no one has sent these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the earth, as eye-openers, and I, O Pharaoh, indeed think you are doomed.’"/>

		<aya index="12" text="Then We aroused them that We might know which of the two groups better reckoned the period they had stayed."/>
		<aya index="13" text="We relate to you their account in truth. They were indeed youths who had faith in their Lord, and We had enhanced them in guidance,"/>
		<aya index="14" text="and fortified their hearts, when they stood up and said, ‘Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never invoke any god besides Him, for then we shall certainly have said an atrocious lie."/>
		<aya index="15" text="These—our people—have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not bring any clear authority touching them? So who is a greater wrongdoer than he who fabricates a lie against Allah?"/>
		<aya index="16" text="When you have dissociated yourselves from them and from what they worship except Allah, then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will unfold His mercy for you, and He will help you on to ease in your affair.’"/>
		<aya index="17" text="You may see the sun, when it rises, slanting toward the right of their cave, and, when it sets, cut across them towards the left, and they are in a cavern within it. That is one of Allah’s signs. Whomever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whomever He leads astray, you will never find for him any guardian or guide."/>
		<aya index="18" text="You will suppose them to be awake, although they are asleep. We turn them to the right and to the left, and their dog [lies] stretching its forelegs at the threshold.

		<aya index="19" text="So it was that We aroused them [from sleep] so that they might question one another. One of them said, ‘How long have you stayed [here]?’ They said, ‘We have stayed a day, or part of a day.’ They said, ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed. Send one of you to the city with this money. Let him observe which of them has the purest food, and bring you provisions from there. Let him be attentive, and let him not make anyone aware of you."/>

As they disputed among themselves about their matter, they said, ‘Build a building over them. Their Lord knows them best.’ Those who had the say in their matter said, ‘We will set up a place of worship over them.’"/>

		<aya index="39" text="“Put him in the casket, and cast it into the river. Then the river will cast it on the bank, and he shall be picked up by an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his.” And I made you endearing, and that you might be reared under My [watchful] eyes."/>
		<aya index="40" text="When your sister walked up [to Pharaoh’s palace] saying, “Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?” Then We restored you to your mother, that she might not grieve and be comforted. Then you slew a soul, whereupon We delivered you from anguish, and We tried you with various ordeals. Then you stayed for several years among the people of Midian. Then you turned up as ordained, O Moses!"/>
		<aya index="41" text="And I chose you for Myself.’"/>
		<aya index="42" text="‘Go ahead, you and your brother, with My signs and do not flag in My remembrance."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Both of you go to Pharaoh, for he has indeed rebelled."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Speak to him in a soft manner; maybe he will take admonition or fear.’"/>
		<aya index="45" text="They said, ‘Our Lord! We are indeed afraid that he will forestall us or will exceed all bounds.’"/>
		<aya index="46" text="He said, ‘Do not be afraid, for I will be with the two of you, hearing and seeing [whatever happens]."/>
		<aya index="47" text="So approach him and say, ‘‘We are the apostles of your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not torture them! We certainly bring you a sign from your Lord, and may peace be upon him who follows guidance!"/>
		<aya index="48" text="Indeed it has been revealed to us that punishment shall befall those who impugn us and turn their backs [on us].’’ ’"/>
		<aya index="49" text="He said, ‘Who is your Lord, Moses?’"/>
		<aya index="50" text="He said, ‘Our Lord is He who gave everything its creation and then guided it.’"/>
		<aya index="51" text="He said, ‘What about the former generations?’"/>
		<aya index="52" text="He said, ‘Their knowledge is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord neither makes any error nor forgets.’"/>
		<aya index="53" text="He, who made the earth for you a cradle, and in it threaded for you ways, and sent down water from the sky, and with it We brought forth various kinds of vegetation."/>
		<aya index="54" text="‘Eat and pasture your cattle.’ There are indeed signs in that for those who have sense."/>
		<aya index="55" text="From it did We create you, into it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you forth another time."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Certainly We showed him all Our signs. But he denied [them] and refused [to believe them]."/>
		<aya index="57" text="He said, ‘Moses, have you come to us to expel us from our land with your magic?"/>
		<aya index="58" text="Yet we [too] will bring you a magic like it! So fix a tryst between us and you, which neither we shall fail nor you, at a middle place.’"/>
		<aya index="59" text="He said, ‘Your tryst shall be the Day of Adornment, and let the people be assembled in early forenoon.’"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Then Pharaoh withdrew [to consult privately], summoned up his guile, and then arrived [at the scene of the contest]."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Moses said to them, ‘Woe to you! Do not fabricate lies against Allah, or He will obliterate you with a punishment. Whoever fabricates lies certainly fails.’"/>
		<aya index="62" text="So they disputed their matter among themselves, and kept their confidential talks secret."/>
		<aya index="63" text="They said, ‘These two are indeed magicians who intend to expel you from your land with their magic, and to abolish your excellent tradition!"/>
		<aya index="64" text="So summon up your ingenuity, then come in ranks. Today he who has the upper hand will be felicitous!’"/>
		<aya index="65" text="They said, ‘O Moses! Will you throw first, or shall we?’"/>
		<aya index="66" text="He said, ‘No, you throw first.’ Thereupon, behold, their ropes and staffs appeared to him by their magic to wriggle swiftly."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Then Moses felt a fear within his heart."/>
		<aya index="68" text="We said, ‘Do not be afraid. Indeed, you will have the upper hand."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Throw down what is in your right hand, and it will swallow what they have conjured. What they have conjured is only a magician’s trick, and the magician does not fare well wherever he may show up.’"/>
		<aya index="70" text="Thereat the magicians fell down prostrating. They said, ‘We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses!’"/>
		<aya index="71" text="He said, ‘Did you believe in him before I should permit you? He is indeed your chief who has taught you magic! Surely, I will cut off your hands and feet from opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will know which of us can inflict a severer and more lasting punishment.’"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They said, ‘We will never prefer you to the clear proofs which have come to us, and to Him who originated us. Decide whatever you want to decide. You can only decide about the life of this world."/>
		<aya index="73" text="We have indeed believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our offences and the magic you compelled us to perform. Allah is better and more lasting.’"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Whoever comes to his Lord laden with guilt, for him shall be hell, where he will neither live nor die."/>
		<aya index="75" text="But whoever comes to Him with faith and he has done righteous deeds, for such shall be the highest ranks"/>
		<aya index="76" text="—the Gardens of Eden, with streams running in them, to abide in them [forever], and that is the reward of him who keeps pure."/>
		<aya index="77" text="We revealed to Moses, [saying], ‘Set out with My servants at night, and strike out for them a dry path through the sea. Do not be afraid of being overtaken, and have no fear [of getting drowned]."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Then Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, whereat they were engulfed by what engulfed them of the sea."/>
		<aya index="79" text="Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them."/>
		<aya index="80" text="O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We appointed with you a tryst on the right side of the Mount and We sent down to you manna and quails:"/>
		<aya index="81" text="‘Eat of the good things We have provided you, but do not overstep the bounds therein, lest My wrath should descend on you, and he on whom My wrath descends certainly perishes."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Indeed I forgive those who repent, become faithful, act righteously, and follow guidance.’"/>
		<aya index="83" text="[God said,] ‘O Moses, what has prompted you to hasten ahead of your people?’"/>
		<aya index="84" text="He said, ‘They are close upon my heels, and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that You may be pleased.’"/>
		<aya index="85" text="He said, ‘Indeed We tried your people in your absence, and the Samiri has led them astray.’"/>
		<aya index="86" text="Thereupon Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved. He said, ‘O my people! Did your Lord not give you a true promise? Did the period [of my absence] seem too long to you? Or did you desire that your Lord’s wrath should descend on you and so you failed your tryst with me?’"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said, ‘We did not fail our tryst with you of our own accord, but we were laden with the weight of those people’s ornaments, and we cast them [into the fire] and so did the Samiri.’"/>
		<aya index="88" text="Then he produced for them a calf—a [lifeless] body with a low—and they said, This is your god and the god of Moses, so he forgot!"/>
		<aya index="89" text="Did they not see that it did not answer them, nor could it bring them any benefit or harm?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Aaron had certainly told them earlier, ‘O my people! You are only being tested by it. Indeed your Lord is the All-beneficent. So follow me and obey my command!’"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They had said, ‘We will keep on clinging to it until Moses returns to us.’"/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said, ‘O Aaron! What kept you, when you saw them going astray,"/>
		<aya index="93" text="from following me? Did you disobey my command?’"/>
		<aya index="94" text="He said, ‘O son of my mother! Do not grab my beard or my head! I feared lest you should say, ‘‘You have caused a rift among the Children of Israel and did not heed my word [of advice].’’’"/>
		<aya index="95" text="He said, ‘What is your business, O Samiri?’"/>
		<aya index="96" text="He said, ‘I saw what they did not see. I took a handful [of dust] from the messenger’s trail and threw it. That is how my soul prompted me.’"/>
		<aya index="97" text="He said, ‘Begone! It shall be your [lot] throughout life to say, ‘‘Do not touch me!’’ Indeed, there is a tryst for you which you will not fail to keep! Now look at your god to whom you went on clinging. We will burn it down and then scatter it[s ashes] into the sea."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Indeed your God is Allah. There is no god except Him. He embraces all things in [His] knowledge.’"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Thus do We relate to you some accounts of what is past. Certainly, We have given you a Reminder from Ourselves."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Whoever disregards it shall bear a burden [of punishment] on the Day of Resurrection,"/>
		<aya index="101" text="remaining in it [forever]. Evil is their burden on the Day of Resurrection"/>
		<aya index="102" text="—the day the Trumpet will be blown; on that day We shall muster the guilty with blind eyes."/>
		<aya index="103" text="They will whisper to one another: ‘You have stayed only for ten [days].’"/>
		<aya index="104" text="We know best what they will say, when the smartest of them in approach will say, ‘You stayed only a day!’"/>
		<aya index="105" text="They question you concerning the mountains. Say, ‘My Lord will scatter them [like dust].’"/>
		<aya index="106" text="Then He will leave it a level plain."/>
		<aya index="107" text="You will not see any crookedness or unevenness in it."/>
		<aya index="108" text="On that day they will follow the summoner without zigzagging. Their voices will be muted before the All-beneficent, and you will hear nothing but a murmur."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Intercession will not avail that day except from him whom the All-beneficent allows and approves of his word."/>
		<aya index="110" text="He knows what is before them and behind them, though they do not comprehend Him in their knowledge."/>
		<aya index="111" text="All faces shall be humbled before the Living One, the All-sustainer, and those who bear [the burden of] wrongdoing will fail."/>
		<aya index="112" text="But whoever does righteous deeds, being faithful, will neither fear any injustice or disparagement."/>
		<aya index="113" text="Thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran and We have paraphrased the warnings in it variously so that they may be Godwary, or it may prompt them to remembrance."/>
		<aya index="114" text="So exalted is Allah, the True Sovereign. Do not hasten with the Quran before its revelation is completed for you, and say, ‘My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.’"/>
		<aya index="115" text="Certainly We had enjoined Adam earlier; but he forgot, and We did not find any resoluteness in him."/>
		<aya index="116" text="When We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they prostrated, but not Iblis: he refused."/>
		<aya index="117" text="We said, ‘O Adam! This is indeed an enemy of yours and your mate’s. So do not let him expel you from paradise, or you will be miserable."/>
		<aya index="118" text="You will neither be hungry in it nor naked."/>
		<aya index="119" text="You will neither be thirsty in it, nor suffer from [the heat of] the sun.’"/>
		<aya index="120" text="Then Satan tempted him. He said, ‘O Adam! Shall I show you the tree of immortality, and an imperishable kingdom?’"/>
		<aya index="121" text="So they both ate of it, and their nakedness became evident to them, and they began to stitch over themselves with the leaves of paradise. Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went amiss."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him clemently, and guided him."/>
		<aya index="123" text="He said, ‘Get down both of you from it, all together, being enemies of one another! Yet, should any guidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance will not go astray, nor will they be miserable."/>
		<aya index="124" text="But whoever disregards My remembrance, his shall be a wretched life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection.’"/>
		<aya index="125" text="He will say, ‘My Lord! Why have You raised me blind, though I used to see?’"/>
		<aya index="126" text="He will say: ‘So it is. Our signs came to you, but you forgot them, and so you will be forgotten today.’"/>
		<aya index="127" text="Thus do We requite those who transgress and do not believe in the signs of their Lord, and the punishment of the Hereafter is severer and more lasting."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Does it not dawn upon them how many generations We have destroyed before them, amid [the ruins of] whose dwellings they walk? There are indeed signs in this for those who have reason."/>
		<aya index="129" text="Were it not for a prior decree of your Lord and a specified time, [their doom] would have attended [their guilt]."/>
		<aya index="130" text="So be patient with what they say, and celebrate the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before the sunset, and glorify Him in watches of the night and at the day’s ends, that you may be pleased."/>
		<aya index="131" text="Do not extend your glance toward what We have provided certain groups of them as a glitter of the life of this world, so that We may test them thereby. The provision of your Lord is better and more lasting."/>
		<aya index="132" text="And bid your family to prayer and be steadfast in maintaining it. We do not ask any provision of you: it is We who provide for you, and to Godwariness belongs the ultimate outcome [in the Hereafter]."/>
		<aya index="133" text="They say, ‘Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?’ Has there not come to them a clear proof in that which is in the former scriptures?"/>
		<aya index="134" text="Had We destroyed them with a punishment before it, they would have surely said, ‘Our Lord! Why did You not send us an apostle so that we might have followed Your signs before we were abased and disgraced?’"/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say, ‘Everyone [of us] is waiting. So wait! Soon you will know who are the people of the right path, and who is [rightly] guided.’"/>

		<aya index="90" text="So We answered his prayer, and gave him John, and cured for him his wife [of infertility]. Indeed, they were active in [performing] good works, and they would supplicate Us with eagerness and awe and were humble before Us."/>

		<aya index="40" text="Or like the manifold darkness in a deep sea, covered by billow upon billow, overcast by clouds; manifold [layers of] darkness, one on top of another: when he brings out his hand, he can hardly see it. One whom Allah has not granted any light has no light."/>

		<aya index="50" text="Is there a sickness in their hearts? Do they have doubts, or fear that Allah and His Apostle will be unjust to them? Indeed, it is they who are the wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="51" text="All the response of the faithful, when they are summoned to Allah and His Apostle that He may judge between them, is to say, ‘We hear and obey.’ It is they who are the felicitous."/>

		<aya index="53" text="They swear by Allah with solemn oaths that if you order them they will surely march out. Say, ‘Do not swear! Honourable obedience [is all that is expected of you]. Allah is indeed well aware of what you do.’"/>
		<aya index="54" text="Say, ‘Obey Allah, and obey the Apostle.’ But if you turn your backs, [you should know that] he is only responsible for his burden and you are responsible for your own burden, and if you obey him, you will be guided, and the Apostle’s duty is only to communicate in clear terms."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Allah has promised those of you who have faith and do righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors in the earth, just as He made those who were before them successors, and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them, and that He will surely change their state to security after their fear, while they worship Me, not ascribing any partners to Me. Whoever is ungrateful after that—it is they who are the transgressors."/>

		<aya index="57" text="Do not suppose that those who are faithless can frustrate [Allah] on the earth. Their refuge shall be the Fire, and it is surely an evil destination."/>
		<aya index="58" text="O you who have faith! Your slaves and any of you who have not yet reached puberty should seek your permission three times: before the dawn prayer, and when you put off your garments at noon, and after the night prayer. These are three times of privacy for you. Apart from these, it is not sinful of you or them to frequent one another [freely]. Thus does Allah clarify the signs for you, and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise."/>
		<aya index="59" text="When your children reach puberty, let them ask permission [at all times] just as those [who grew up] before them asked permission. Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you, and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise."/>
		<aya index="60" text="As for women advanced in years who do not expect to marry, there will be no sin upon them if they put off their cloaks, without displaying their adornment. But it is better for them to be modest, and Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="61" text="There is no blame upon the blind, nor any blame upon the lame, nor any blame upon the sick, nor upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses, or your fathers’ houses, or your mothers’ houses, or your brothers’ houses, or your sisters’ houses, or the houses of your paternal uncles, or the houses of your paternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles, or the houses of your maternal aunts, or those whose keys are in your possession, or those of your friends. There will be no blame on you whether you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet yourselves with a salutation from Allah, blessed and good. Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may exercise your reason."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Indeed the faithful are those who have faith in Allah and His Apostle, and when they are with him in a collective affair, they do not leave until they have sought his permission. Indeed those who seek your permission are those who have faith in Allah and His Apostle. So when they seek your permission for some of theirs [private] work, give permission to whomever of them you wish and plead with Allah to forgive them. Indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Do not consider the Apostle’s summons amongst you to be like your summoning one another. Allah certainly knows those of you who slip away shielding one another. Those who disobey his orders should beware lest an affliction should visit them or a painful punishment should befall them."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Behold! To Allah indeed belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He certainly knows your present state. The day they are brought back to Him He will inform them about what they have done, and Allah has knowledge of all things."/>

		<aya index="2" text="These are the signs of the Manifest Book."/>
		<aya index="3" text="We relate to you truly some of the account of Moses and Pharaoh for a people who have faith."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Indeed Pharaoh tyrannized over the land, reducing its people to factions, abasing one group of them, slaughtering their sons, and sparing their women. Indeed, He was one of the agents of corruption."/>
		<aya index="5" text="And We desired to show favour to those who were abased in the land, and to make them imams, and to make them the heirs,"/>
		<aya index="6" text="and to establish them in the land, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts from them that of which they were apprehensive."/>
		<aya index="7" text="We revealed to Moses’ mother, [saying], ‘Nurse him; then, when you fear for him, cast him into the river, and do not fear or grieve, for We will restore him to you and make him one of the apostles.’"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then Pharaoh’s kinsmen picked him up that he might be an enemy and a cause of grief to them. Indeed Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were iniquitous."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Pharaoh’s wife said [to him], ‘[This infant will be] a [source of] comfort to me and to you. Do not kill him. Maybe he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son.’ But they were not aware."/>
		<aya index="10" text="The heart of Moses’ mother became desolate, and indeed she was about to divulge it had We not fortified her heart so that she might have faith [in Allah’s promise]."/>
		<aya index="11" text="She said to his sister, ‘Follow him.’ So she watched him from a distance, while they were not aware."/>
		<aya index="12" text="Since before We had forbidden him to be suckled by any nurse. So she said, ‘Shall I show you a household that will take care of him for you and they will be his well-wishers?’"/>
		<aya index="13" text="That is how We restored him to his mother so that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that Allah’s promise is true, but most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When he came of age and became fully matured, We gave him judgement and knowledge, and thus do We reward the virtuous."/>
		<aya index="15" text="[One day] he entered the city at a time when its people were not likely to take notice. He found there two men fighting, this one from among his followers, and that one from his enemies. The one who was from his followers sought his help against him who was from his enemies. So Moses hit him with his fist, whereupon he expired. He said, ‘This is of Satan’s doing. Indeed he is clearly a misguiding enemy.’"/>
		<aya index="16" text="He said, ‘My Lord! I have wronged myself. Forgive me!’ So He forgave him. Indeed, He is the All-forgiving, the All-merciful."/>
		<aya index="17" text="He said, ‘My Lord! As You have blessed me, I will never be a supporter of the guilty.’"/>
		<aya index="18" text="He rose at dawn in the city, fearful and vigilant, when behold, the one who had sought his help the day before, shouted for his help [once again]. Moses said to him, ‘You are indeed clearly perverse!’"/>
		<aya index="19" text="But when he wanted to strike him who was an enemy of both of them, he said, ‘Moses, do you want to kill me, just like the one you killed yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be one who brings about reform.’"/>
		<aya index="20" text="There came a man from the city outskirts, hurrying. He said, ‘Moses! The elite are indeed conspiring to kill you. So leave. I am indeed your well-wisher.’"/>
		<aya index="21" text="So he left the city, fearful and vigilant. He said, ‘My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing lot.’"/>
		<aya index="22" text="And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said, ‘Maybe my Lord will show me the right way.’"/>
		<aya index="23" text="When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found there a throng of people watering [their flocks], and he found, besides them, two women holding back [their flock]. He said, ‘What is your business?’ They said, ‘We do not water [our flock] until the shepherds have driven out [their flocks], and our father is an aged man.’"/>
		<aya index="24" text="So he watered [their flock] for them. Then he withdrew toward the shade and said, ‘My Lord! I am indeed in need of any good You may send down to me!’"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully. She said, ‘Indeed my father invites you to pay you the wages for watering [our flock] for us.’ So when he came to him and recounted the story to him, he said, ‘Do not be afraid. You have been delivered from the wrongdoing lot.’"/>
		<aya index="26" text="One of the two women said, ‘Father, hire him. Indeed the best you can hire is a powerful and trustworthy man.’"/>
		<aya index="27" text="He said, ‘Indeed I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, on condition that you hire yourself to me for eight years. And if you complete ten, that will be up to you, and I do not want to be hard on you. God willing, you will find me to a righteous person.’"/>
		<aya index="28" text="He said, ‘This will be [by consent] between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there shall be no imposition upon me, and Allah is witness over what we say.’"/>
		<aya index="29" text="So when Moses completed the term and set out with his family, he descried a fire on the side of the mountain. He said to his family, ‘Wait! Indeed, I descry a fire! Maybe I will bring you some news from it, or a brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves.’"/>
		<aya index="30" text="When he approached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley in that blessed site from the tree: ‘Moses! Indeed I am Allah, the Lord of all the worlds!’"/>
		<aya index="31" text="And: ‘Throw down your staff!’ And when he saw it wriggling as if it were a snake, he turned his back [to flee], without looking back. ‘Moses! Come forward, and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe.’"/>
		<aya index="32" text="‘Insert your hand into your shirt. It will emerge white, without any fault, and keep your arms drawn in awe to your sides. These shall be two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his elite. They are indeed a transgressing lot.’"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said, ‘My Lord! Indeed, I have killed one of their men, so I fear they will kill me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="Aaron, my brother—he is more eloquent than me in speech. So send him with me as a helper to confirm me, for I fear that they will impugn me.’"/>
		<aya index="35" text="He said, ‘We will strengthen your arm by means of your brother, and invest both of you with such authority that they will not touch you. With the help of Our signs, you two, and those who follow the two of you, shall be the victors.’"/>
		<aya index="36" text="When Moses brought them Our manifest signs, they said, ‘This is nothing but concocted magic. We never heard of such a thing among our forefathers.’"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Moses said, ‘My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him, and in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be. The wrongdoers will not be felicitous.’"/>
		<aya index="38" text="Pharaoh said, ‘O [members of the] elite! I do not know of any god that you may have besides me. Haman, light for me a fire over clay, and build me a tower so that I may take a look at Moses’ god, and indeed I consider him to be a liar!’"/>
		<aya index="39" text="He and his hosts unduly acted arrogantly in the land, and thought they would not be brought back to Us."/>
		<aya index="40" text="So We seized him and his hosts, and threw them into the sea. So observe how was the fate of the wrongdoers!"/>
		<aya index="41" text="We made them leaders who invite to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not receive any help."/>
		<aya index="42" text="We made a curse pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the disfigured."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Certainly We gave Moses the Book, after We had destroyed the former generations, as [a set of] eye-openers, guidance and mercy for mankind, so that they may take admonition."/>
		<aya index="44" text="You were not on the western side when We revealed the commandments to Moses, nor were you among the witnesses."/>
		<aya index="45" text="But We brought forth other generations and time took its toll on them. You did not dwell among the people of Midian reciting to them Our signs, but it is We who are the senders [of the apostles]."/>
		<aya index="46" text="And you were not on the side of the Mount when We called out [to Moses], but [We have sent you as] a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom there did not come any warner before you, so that they may take admonition."/>
		<aya index="47" text="And lest—if an affliction were to befall them because of what their hands have sent ahead —they should say, ‘Our Lord! Why did You not send us an apostle so that we might have followed Your signs and been among the faithful?’"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But when there came to them the truth from Us, they said, ‘Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?’ Did they not disbelieve what Moses was given before, and said, ‘Two magicians abetting each other,’ and said, ‘Indeed we disbelieve both of them’?"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say, ‘If you are truthful, bring some Book from Allah better in guidance than the two on them so that I may follow it.’"/>
		<aya index="50" text="Then if they do not respond to you[r] [summons], know that they only follow their desires, and who is more astray than him who follows his desires without any guidance from Allah? Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Certainly We have carried on this discourse for them so that they may take admonition."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Those to whom We gave the Book before it are the ones who believe in it,"/>
		<aya index="53" text="and when it is recited to them, they say, ‘We believe in it. It is indeed the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were Muslims [even] before it [came].’"/>
		<aya index="54" text="Those will be given their reward two times for their patience. They repel evil [conduct] with good, and spend out of what We have provided them,"/>
		<aya index="55" text="and when they hear vain talk, they avoid it and say, ‘Our deeds belong to us, and your deeds belong to you. Peace be to you. We do not court the ignorant.’"/>
		<aya index="56" text="You cannot guide whomever you wish, but [it is] Allah [who] guides whomever He wishes, and He knows best those who are guided."/>
		<aya index="57" text="They say, ‘If we follow the guidance with you, we will be forced out of our territory.’ Did We not establish a secure sanctuary for them where fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know."/>
		<aya index="58" text="How many a town We have destroyed that exulted in its lifestyle! There lie their dwellings, uninhabited after them except by a few, and We were the [sole] inheritors."/>
		<aya index="59" text="Your Lord would not destroy the towns until He had raised an apostle in their mother city to recite to them Our signs. We would never destroy the towns except when their people were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Whatever things you have been given are only the wares of the life of this world and its glitter, and what is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will you not exercise your reason?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Is he to whom We have given a good promise, which he will receive, like him whom We have provided the wares of the life of this world, but who will be arraigned on the Day of Resurrection?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="The day He will call out to them and ask, ‘Where are My ‘partners’ that you used to claim?’"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those against whom the word had become due will say, ‘Our Lord! These are the ones whom we have perverted. We perverted them as we were perverse ourselves. We repudiate them before You: it was not us that they worshipped.’"/>
		<aya index="64" text="It will be said, ‘Invoke your partners!’ So they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them, and they will sight the punishment, wishing they had followed guidance."/>
		<aya index="65" text="The day He will call out to them and say, ‘What response did you give to the apostles?’"/>
		<aya index="66" text="That day all information will be withheld from them, so they will not question one another."/>
		<aya index="67" text="As for him who repents, has faith and acts righteously, maybe he will be among the felicitous."/>
		<aya index="68" text="Your Lord creates whatever He wishes and chooses: they have no choice. Immaculate is Allah and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Your Lord knows whatever their breasts conceal, and whatever they disclose."/>
		<aya index="70" text="He is Allah, there is no god except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this world and the Hereafter. All judgement belongs to Him, and to Him you will be brought back."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah can bring you light? Will you not listen?’"/>
		<aya index="72" text="Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah can bring you night wherein you can rest? Will you not perceive?’"/>
		<aya index="73" text="He has made for you the night and the day out of His mercy, so that you may rest therein and that you may seek His bounty and so that you may give thanks."/>
		<aya index="74" text="The day He will call out to them and say, ‘Where are My ‘partners’ that you used to claim?’"/>
		<aya index="75" text="We shall draw from every nation a witness and say, ‘Produce your evidence.’ Then they will know that all reality belongs to Allah and what they used to fabricate will forsake them."/>
		<aya index="76" text="Korah indeed belonged to the people of Moses, but he bullied them. We had given him so much treasures that their chests indeed proved heavy for a band of stalwarts. When his people said to him, ‘Do not boast! Indeed Allah does not like the boasters."/>
		<aya index="77" text="Seek the abode of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has given you, while not forgetting your share of this world. Be good [to others] just as Allah has been good to you, and do not try to cause corruption in the land. Indeed Allah does not like the agents of corruption.’"/>
		<aya index="78" text="He said, ‘I have indeed been given [all] this because of the knowledge that I have.’ Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed before him some of the generations who were more powerful than him and greater in amassing [wealth]? The guilty will not be questioned about their sins."/>
		<aya index="79" text="So he emerged before his people in his finery. Those who desired the life of the world said, ‘We wish we had like what Korah has been given! Indeed he is greatly fortunate.’"/>
		<aya index="80" text="Those who were given knowledge said [to them], ‘Woe to you! Allah’s reward is better for someone who has faith and acts righteously, and no one will receive it except the patient.’"/>
		<aya index="81" text="So We caused the earth to swallow him and his house, and he had no party that might protect him from Allah, nor could he rescue himself."/>
		<aya index="82" text="By dawn those who longed to be in his place the day before were saying, ‘Don’t you see that Allah expands the provision for whomever He wishes of His servants, and tightens it? Had Allah not shown us favour, He might have made the earth swallow us too. Don’t you see that the faithless do not prosper?’"/>
		<aya index="83" text="This is the abode of the Hereafter, which We shall grant to those who do not desire to domineer in the earth nor to cause corruption, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Whoever brings virtue shall receive [a reward] better than it, but whoever brings vice—those who commit misdeeds shall not be requited except for what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="85" text="Indeed He who has revealed to you the Quran will surely restore you to the place of return. Say, ‘My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error.’"/>
		<aya index="86" text="You did not expect that the Book would be delivered to you; but it was a mercy from your Lord. So do not be ever an advocate of the faithless."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Do not ever let them bar you from Allah’s signs after they have been sent down to you. Invite to your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And do not invoke another god besides Allah; there is no god except Him. Everything is to perish except His Face. All judgement belongs to Him, and to Him you will be brought back."/>

		<aya index="19" text="They have made the angels—who are servants of the All-beneficent—females. Were they witness to their creation? Their testimony will be written down and they shall be questioned."/>

		<aya index="22" text="No, they said, ‘We found our fathers following a creed, and we are indeed guided in their footsteps.’"/>
		<aya index="23" text="So it has been that We did not send any warner to a town before you, without its affluent ones saying, ‘We found our fathers following a creed and we are indeed following in their footsteps.’"/>
		<aya index="24" text="He would say, ‘What! Even if I bring you a better guidance than what you found your fathers following?!’ They would say, ‘We indeed disbelieve in what you are sent with.’"/>

		<aya index="38" text="When he comes to Us, he will say, ‘I wish there had been between me and you the distance between the east and the west! What an evil companion [you are]!’"/>

		<aya index="43" text="So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Indeed it is a reminder for you and your people, and soon you will be questioned."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Ask those of Our apostles We have sent before you: Did We set up any gods to be worshipped besides the All-beneficent?"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his elite. He said, ‘I am indeed an apostle of the Lord of all the worlds.’"/>
		<aya index="47" text="But when he brought them Our signs, they indeed laughed at them."/>
		<aya index="48" text="We did not show them a sign but it was greater than the other, and We visited on them punishment so that they might come back."/>
		<aya index="49" text="They would say, ‘O magician! Invoke your Lord for us by the covenant He has made with you [to remove this scourge]. We will indeed be guided [when it is removed].’"/>
		<aya index="50" text="But when We lifted the punishment from them, behold, they would break their pledge."/>
		<aya index="51" text="And Pharaoh proclaimed to his people, saying, ‘O my people! Do not the kingdom of Egypt and these rivers that run at my feet belong to me? Do you not perceive?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Am I not better than this wretch who cannot even speak clearly?"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Why no bracelets of gold have been thrown to him, nor any angels accompany him as escorts?’"/>
		<aya index="54" text="Thus did he mislead his people and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were a transgressing lot."/>
		<aya index="55" text="So when they roused Our wrath, We took vengeance on them and drowned them all."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Thus We made them the vanguard and an example for posterity."/>
		<aya index="57" text="When the Son of Mary was cited as an example, behold, your people raise an outcry."/>
		<aya index="58" text="They say, ‘Are our gods better or he?’ They cite him to you only for the sake of contention. Indeed, they are a contentious lot."/>
		<aya index="59" text="He was just a servant whom We had blessed and made an exemplar for the Children of Israel."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Had We wished We would have set angels in your stead to be [your] successors on the earth."/>
		<aya index="61" text="[Say,] ‘Indeed he is a portent of the Hour; so do not doubt it and follow me. This is a straight path."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Do not let Satan bar you [from the way of Allah]. Indeed he is your manifest enemy.’"/>
		<aya index="63" text="When Jesus brought those manifest proofs, he said, ‘I have certainly brought you wisdom, and [I have come] to make clear to you some of the things that you differ about. So be wary of Allah and obey me."/>
		<aya index="64" text="Indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is a straight path.’"/>
		<aya index="65" text="But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to the wrongdoers for the punishment of a painful day."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Do they not consider that the Hour may overtake them suddenly while they are unaware?"/>

		<aya index="76" text="We did not wrong them, but they themselves were wrongdoers."/>
		<aya index="77" text="They will call out, ‘O Malik! Let your Lord finish us off!’ He will say, ‘Indeed you will stay on.’"/>
